INSTALLATION METHODS Depending on your requirements, you can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux using several methods. Review the following sections to determine the best installation method for your requirements. 2.1. AVAILABLE INSTALLATION METHODS You can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux using any of the following methods: GUI-based installations System or cloud image-based installations Advanced installations GUI-based installations You can choose from the following GUI-based installation methods: Install RHEL using an ISO image from the Customer Portal: Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux by downloading the DVD ISO image file from the Customer Portal. Registration is performed after the installation completes. This installation method is supported by the GUI and Kickstart. Register and install RHEL from the Content Delivery Network: Register your system, attach subscriptions, and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux from the Content Delivery Network (CDN). This installation method supports Boot ISO and DVD ISO image files; however, the Boot ISO image file is recommended as the installation source defaults to CDN for the Boot ISO image file. After registering the system, the installer downloads and installs packages from the CDN. This installation method is also supported by Kickstart. Perform a remote RHEL installation using VNC: The RHEL installation program offers two Virtual Network Computing (VNC) installation modes: Direct and Connect. After a connection is established, the two modes do not differ. The mode you select depends on your environment. Install RHEL from the network using PXE : With a network installation using preboot execution environment (PXE), you can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux to a system that has access to an installation server. At a minimum, two systems are required for a network installation. System or cloud image-based installations You can use system or cloud image-based installation methods only in virtual and cloud environments. To perform a system or cloud image-based installation, use Red Hat Image Builder. Image builder creates customized system images of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including the system images for cloud deployment.

Advanced installations You can choose from the following advanced installation methods: Perform an automated RHEL installation using Kickstart: Kickstart is an automated process that helps you install the operating system by specifying all your requirements and configurations in a file. The Kickstart file contains RHEL installation options, for example, the CHAPTER 2. INSTALLATION METHODS 9 time zone, drive partitions, or packages to be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file completes installation without the need for any user intervention. This is useful when deploying Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a large number of systems at once. Register and install RHEL from the Content Delivery Network: Register and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on all architectures from the Content Delivery Network (CDN). Registration is performed before the installation packages are downloaded and installed from CDN. This installation method is supported by the graphical user interface and Kickstart.

PERFORMING AN AUTOMATED INSTALLATION USING KICKSTART 11 CHAPTER 3. KICKSTART INSTALLATION BASICS The following provides basic information about Kickstart and how to use it to automate installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 3.1. WHAT ARE KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS Kickstart provides a way to automate the RHEL installation process, either partially or fully. Kickstart files contain some or all of the RHEL installation options. For example, the time zone, how the drives should be partitioned, or which packages should be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file allows an installation without the need for any user intervention. This is especially useful when deploying Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a large number of systems at once. Kickstart files also provide more options regarding software selection. When installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux manually using the graphical installation interface, the software selection is limited to pre-defined environments and add-ons.

This installation method supports the use of a single Kickstart file to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux on multiple machines, making it ideal for network and system administrators. All Kickstart scripts and log files of their execution are stored in the /tmp directory of the newly installed system to assist with debugging installation issues. The kickstart used for installation as well as the Anaconda generated output kickstart are stored in /root on the target system and that logs from kickstart scriptlet execution are stored in /var/log/anaconda. NOTE In previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Kickstart could be used for upgrading systems. Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, this functionality has been removed and system upgrades are instead handled by specialized tools. For details on upgrading to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, see Upgrading from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9 and Considerations in adopting RHEL. 3.2. AUTOMATED INSTALLATION WORKFLOW Kickstart installations can be performed using a local DVD, a local hard drive, or a NFS, FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS server. This section provides a high level overview of Kickstart usage. 1. Create a Kickstart file. You can write it by hand, copy a Kickstart file saved after a manual installation, or use an online generator tool to create the file, and edit it afterward. See Creating Kickstart files. 2. Make the Kickstart file available to the installation program on removable media, a hard drive or a network location using an HTTP(S), FTP, or NFS server. See Making Kickstart files available to the installation program. 3. Create the boot medium which will be used to begin the installation. See Creating a bootable installation medium and Preparing to install from the network using PXE. 4. Make the installation source available to the installation program. See Creating installation sources for Kickstart installations. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 12 5. Start the installation using the boot medium and the Kickstart file. See Starting Kickstart installations.

CHAPTER 3. KICKSTART INSTALLATION BASICS 13 CHAPTER 4. CREATING KICKSTART FILES You can create a Kickstart file using the following methods: Use the online Kickstart configuration tool. Copy the Kickstart file created as a result of a manual installation. Write the entire Kickstart file manually. Convert the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Kickstart file for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 installation. For more information about the conversion tool, see Kickstart generator lab. In case of virtual and cloud environment, create a custom system image, using Image Builder. Note that some highly specific installation options can be configured only by manual editing of the Kickstart file. 4.1. CREATING A KICKSTART FILE WITH THE KICKSTART CONFIGURATION TOOL Users with a Red Hat Customer Portal account can use the Kickstart Generator tool in the Customer Portal Labs to generate Kickstart files online. This tool will walk you through the basic configuration and enables you to download the resulting Kickstart file. Prerequisites You have a Red Hat Customer Portal account and an active Red Hat subscription. Procedure 1. Open the Kickstart generator lab information page at https://access.redhat.com/labsinfo/kickstartconfig. 2. Click the Go to Application button to the left of heading and wait for the next page to load. 3. Select Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 in the drop-down menu and wait for the page to update. 4. Describe the system to be installed using the fields in the form. You can use the links on the left side of the form to quickly navigate between sections of the form. 5. To download the generated Kickstart file, click the red Download button at the top of the page. Your web browser saves the file. 4.2. CREATING A KICKSTART FILE BY PERFORMING A MANUAL INSTALLATION The recommended approach to creating Kickstart files is to use the file created by a manual installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. After an installation completes, all choices made during the installation are saved into a Kickstart file named anaconda-ks.cfg, located in the /root/ directory on the installed system.

MAKING A KICKSTART FILE AVAILABLE ON AN NFS SERVER This procedure describes how to store the Kickstart script file on an NFS server. This method enables you to install multiple systems from a single source without having to use physical media for the Kickstart file. Prerequisites You have an administrator-level access to a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on the local network. The system to be installed can connect to the server. The firewall on the server allows connections from the system you are installing to. Procedure 1. Install the nfs-utils package by running the following command as root: # dnf install nfs-utils Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 16 2. Copy the Kickstart file to a directory on the NFS server. 3. Open the /etc/exports file using a text editor and add a line with the following syntax: /exported_directory/ clients 4. Replace /exported_directory/ with the full path to the directory holding the Kickstart file. Instead of clients, use the host name or IP address of the computer that is to be installed from this NFS server, the subnetwork from which all computers are to have access the ISO image, or the asterisk sign (*) if you want to allow any computer with network access to the NFS server to use the ISO image. See the exports(5) man page for detailed information about the format of this field. A basic configuration that makes the /rhel9-install/ directory available as read-only to all clients is: /rhel9-install * 5. Save the /etc/exports file and exit the text editor. 6. Start the nfs service: # systemctl start nfs-server.service If the service was running before you changed the /etc/exports file, enter the following command, in order for the running NFS server to reload its configuration: # systemctl reload nfs-server.service The Kickstart file is now accessible over NFS and ready to be used for installation.

Kickstart file is now accessible over NFS and ready to be used for installation. NOTE When specifying the Kickstart source, use nfs: as the protocol, the server’s host name or IP address, the colon sign (:), and the path inside directory holding the file. For example, if the server’s host name is myserver.example.com and you have saved the file in /rhel9- install/my-ks.cfg, specify inst.ks=nfs:myserver.example.com:/rhel9-install/my-ks.cfg as the installation source boot option. Additional resources Preparing to install from the network using PXE 5.3. MAKING A KICKSTART FILE AVAILABLE ON AN HTTP OR HTTPS SERVER This procedure describes how to store the Kickstart script file on an HTTP or HTTPS server. This method enables you to install multiple systems from a single source without having to use physical media for the Kickstart file. Prerequisites You have an administrator-level access to a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on the local network. CHAPTER 5. MAKING KICKSTART FILES AVAILABLE TO THE INSTALLATION PROGRAM 17 The system to be installed can connect to the server. The firewall on the server allows connections from the system you are installing to. Procedure 1. To store the Kickstart file on an HTTP, install the httpd package: # dnf install httpd To store the Kickstart file on an HTTPS, install httpd and mod_ssl packages: # dnf install httpd mod_ssl WARNING If your Apache web server configuration enables SSL security, verify that you only enable the TLSv1 protocol, and disable SSLv2 and SSLv3. This is due to the POODLE SSL vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1232413 for details. IMPORTANT If you use an HTTPS server with a self-signed certificate, you must boot the installation program with the inst.noverifyssl option. 2.

Kickstart file is now accessible and ready to be used for installation. NOTE When specifying the location of the Kickstart file, use http:// or https:// as the protocol, the server’s host name or IP address, and the path of the Kickstart file, relative to the HTTP server root. For example, if you are using HTTP, the server’s host name is myserver.example.com, and you have copied the Kickstart file as /var/www/html/rhel9- install/my-ks.cfg, specify http://myserver.example.com/rhel9-install/my-ks.cfg as the file location.

MAKING A KICKSTART FILE AVAILABLE ON AN FTP SERVER This procedure describes how to store the Kickstart script file on an FTP server. This method enables you to install multiple systems from a single source without having to use physical media for the Kickstart file. Prerequisites You have an administrator-level access to a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on the local network. The system to be installed can connect to the server. The firewall on the server allows connections from the system you are installing to. Procedure 1. Install the vsftpd package by running the following command as root: # dnf install vsftpd 2. Open and edit the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf configuration file in a text editor. a. Change the line anonymous_enable=NO to anonymous_enable=YES b. Change the line write_enable=YES to write_enable=NO. c. Add lines pasv_min_port=min_port and pasv_max_port=max_port. Replace min_port and max_port with the port number range used by FTP server in passive mode, e. g. 10021 and 10031. This step can be necessary in network environments featuring various firewall/NAT setups. d. Optionally, add custom changes to your configuration.

If you configured SSL/TLS security in your vsftpd.conf file, ensure that you enable only the TLSv1 protocol, and disable SSLv2 and SSLv3. This is due to the POODLE SSL vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1234773 for details. 3. Configure the server firewall. a. Enable the firewall: # systemctl enable firewalld # systemctl start firewalld b. Enable in your firewall the FTP port and port range from previous step:  CHAPTER 5. MAKING KICKSTART FILES AVAILABLE TO THE INSTALLATION PROGRAM 19 # firewall-cmd --add-port min_port-max_port/tcp --permanent # firewall-cmd --add-service ftp --permanent # firewall-cmd --reload Replace min_port-max_port with the port numbers you entered into the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf configuration file. 4. Copy the Kickstart file to the FTP server into the /var/ftp/ directory or its subdirectory. 5. Make sure that the correct SELinux context and access mode is set on the file: # restorecon -r /var/ftp/your-kickstart-file.ks # chmod 444 /var/ftp/your-kickstart-file.ks 6. Start the vsftpd service: # systemctl start vsftpd.service If the service was running before you changed the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf file, restart the service to load the edited file: # systemctl restart vsftpd.service Enable the vsftpd service to start during the boot process: # systemctl enable vsftpd The Kickstart file is now accessible and ready to be used for installations by systems on the same network. NOTE When configuring the installation source, use ftp:// as the protocol, the server’s host name or IP address, and the path of the Kickstart file, relative to the FTP server root.

MAKING A KICKSTART FILE AVAILABLE ON A LOCAL VOLUME This procedure describes how to store the Kickstart script file on a volume on the system to be installed. This method enables you to bypass the need for another system. Prerequisites You have a drive that can be moved to the machine to be installed, such as a USB stick. The drive contains a partition that can be read by the installation program. The supported types are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, and fat. The drive is connected to the system and its volumes are mounted. Procedure Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 20 1. List volume information and note the UUID of the volume to which you want to copy the Kickstart file. # lsblk -l -p -o name,rm,ro,hotplug,size,type,mountpoint,uuid 2. Navigate to the file system on the volume. 3. Copy the Kickstart file to this file system. 4. Make a note of the string to use later with the inst.ks= option. This string is in the form hd:UUID=volume-UUID:path/to/kickstart-file.cfg. Note that the path is relative to the file system root, not to the / root of file system hierarchy. Replace volume-UUID with the UUID you noted earlier. 5. Unmount all drive volumes: # umount /dev/xyz ... Add all the volumes to the command, separated by spaces. 5.6. MAKING A KICKSTART FILE AVAILABLE ON A LOCAL VOLUME FOR AUTOMATIC LOADING A specially named Kickstart file can be present in the root of a specially named volume on the system to be installed. This lets you bypass the need for another system, and makes the installation program load the file automatically. Prerequisites You have a drive that can be moved to the machine to be installed, such as a USB stick. The drive contains a partition that can be read by the installation program.

CREATING INSTALLATION SOURCES FOR KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS This section describes how to create an installation source for the Boot ISO image using the DVD ISO image that contains the required repositories and software packages. 6.1. TYPES OF INSTALLATION SOURCE You can use one of the following installation sources for minimal boot images: DVD: Burn the DVD ISO image to a DVD. The DVD will be automatically used as the installation source (software package source). Hard drive or USB drive: Copy the DVD ISO image to the drive and configure the installation program to install the software packages from the drive. If you use a USB drive, verify that it is connected to the system before the installation begins. The installation program cannot detect media after the installation begins. Hard drive limitation: The DVD ISO image on the hard drive must be on a partition with a file system that the installation program can mount. The supported file systems are xfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, and vfat (FAT32). WARNING On Microsoft Windows systems, the default file system used when formatting hard drives is NTFS.

If you are creating a hard drive or a USB drive as an installation source on Microsoft Windows, verify that you formatted the drive as FAT32. Note that the FAT32 file system cannot store files larger than 4 GiB. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, you can enable installation from a directory on a local hard drive. To do so, you need to copy the contents of the DVD ISO image to a directory on a hard drive and then specify the directory as the installation source instead of the ISO image. For example: inst.repo=hd:<device>:<path to the directory> Network location: Copy the DVD ISO image or the installation tree (extracted contents of the DVD ISO image) to a network location and perform the installation over the network using the following protocols: NFS: The DVD ISO image is in a Network File System (NFS) share. HTTPS, HTTP or FTP: The installation tree is on a network location that is accessible over HTTP, HTTPS or FTP. 6.2.

CREATING AN INSTALLATION SOURCE ON AN NFS SERVER Use this installation method to install multiple systems from a single source, without having to connect to physical media. Prerequisites You have an administrator-level access to a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, and this server is on the same network as the system to be installed. You have downloaded a Binary DVD image. For more information, see Downloading the installation ISO image. You have created a bootable CD, DVD, or USB device from the image file.

have verified that your firewall allows the system you are installing to access the remote installation source. For more information, see Ports for network-based installation. Procedure 1. Install the nfs-utils package: # dnf install nfs-utils 2. Copy the DVD ISO image to a directory on the NFS server. 3. Open the /etc/exports file using a text editor and add a line with the following syntax: /exported_directory/ clients Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 24 Replace /exported_directory/ with the full path to the directory with the ISO image. Replace clients with one of the following: The host name or IP address of the target system The subnetwork that all target systems can use to access the ISO image To allow any system with network access to the NFS server to use the ISO image, the asterisk sign (*) See the exports(5) man page for detailed information about the format of this field. For example, a basic configuration that makes the /rhel9-install/ directory available as read- only to all clients is: /rhel9-install * 4. Save the /etc/exports file and exit the text editor. 5. Start the nfs service: # systemctl start nfs-server.service If the service was running before you changed the /etc/exports file, reload the NFS server configuration: # systemctl reload nfs-server.service The ISO image is now accessible over NFS and ready to be used as an installation source. NOTE When configuring the installation source, use nfs: as the protocol, the server host name or IP address, the colon sign (:), and the directory holding the ISO image. For example, if the server host name is myserver.example.com and you have saved the ISO image in /rhel9-install/, specify nfs:myserver.example.com:/rhel9-install/ as the installation source. 6.4. CREATING AN INSTALLATION SOURCE USING HTTP OR HTTPS You can create an installation source for a network-based installation using an installation tree, which is a directory containing extracted contents of the DVD ISO image and a valid .treeinfo file.

have an administrator-level access to a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, and this server is on the same network as the system to be installed. You have downloaded a Binary DVD image. For more information, see Downloading the installation ISO image. You have created a bootable CD, DVD, or USB device from the image file. For more CHAPTER 6. CREATING INSTALLATION SOURCES FOR KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS 25 You have created a bootable CD, DVD, or USB device from the image file. For more information, see Creating installation media. You have verified that your firewall allows the system you are installing to access the remote installation source. For more information, see Ports for network-based installation. The httpd package is installed. The mod_ssl package is installed, if you use the https installation source. WARNING If your Apache web server configuration enables SSL security, prefer to enable the TLSv1.3 protocol. By default, TLSv1.2 (LEGACY) is enabled. IMPORTANT If you use an HTTPS server with a self-signed certificate, you must boot the installation program with the noverifyssl option. Procedure 1. Copy the DVD ISO image to the HTTP(S) server. 2. Create a suitable directory for mounting the DVD ISO image, for example: # mkdir /mnt/rhel9-install/ 3. Mount the DVD ISO image to the directory: # mount -o loop,ro -t iso9660 /image_directory/image.iso /mnt/rhel9-install/ Replace /image_directory/image.iso with the path to the DVD ISO image. 4. Copy the files from the mounted image to the HTTP(S) server root. # cp -r /mnt/rhel9-install/ /var/www/html/ This command creates the /var/www/html/rhel9-install/ directory with the content of the image. Note that some other copying methods might skip the .treeinfo file which is required for a valid installation source. Entering the cp command for entire directories as shown in this procedure copies .treeinfo correctly. 5.

 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 26 NOTE When configuring the installation source, use http:// or https:// as the protocol, the server host name or IP address, and the directory that contains the files from the ISO image, relative to the HTTP server root. For example, if you use HTTP, the server host name is myserver.example.com, and you have copied the files from the image to /var/www/html/rhel9-install/, specify http://myserver.example.com/rhel9-install/ as the installation source. Additional resources Deploying different types of servers 6.5. CREATING AN INSTALLATION SOURCE USING FTP You can create an installation source for a network-based installation using an installation tree, which is a directory containing extracted contents of the DVD ISO image and a valid .treeinfo file. The installation source is accessed over FTP. Prerequisites You have an administrator-level access to a server with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, and this server is on the same network as the system to be installed. You have downloaded a Binary DVD image. For more information, see Downloading the installation ISO image. You have created a bootable CD, DVD, or USB device from the image file. For more information, see Creating installation media. You have verified that your firewall allows the system you are installing to access the remote installation source. For more information, see Ports for network-based installation. The vsftpd package is installed. Procedure 1. Open and edit the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf configuration file in a text editor. a. Change the line anonymous_enable=NO to anonymous_enable=YES b. Change the line write_enable=YES to write_enable=NO. c. Add lines pasv_min_port=<min_port> and pasv_max_port=<max_port>. Replace <min_port> and <max_port> with the port number range used by FTP server in passive mode, for example, 10021 and 10031. This step might be necessary in network environments featuring various firewall/NAT setups. d. Optional: Add custom changes to your configuration.

This procedure assumes that default options are used. CHAPTER 6. CREATING INSTALLATION SOURCES FOR KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS 27 WARNING If you configured SSL/TLS security in your vsftpd.conf file, ensure that you enable only the TLSv1 protocol, and disable SSLv2 and SSLv3. This is due to the POODLE SSL vulnerability (CVE-2014-3566). See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1234773 for details. 2. Configure the server firewall. a. Enable the firewall: # systemctl enable firewalld b. Start the firewall: # systemctl start firewalld c. Configure the firewall to allow the FTP port and port range from the previous step: # firewall-cmd --add-port min_port-max_port/tcp --permanent # firewall-cmd --add-service ftp --permanent Replace <min_port> and <max_port> with the port numbers you entered into the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf configuration file. d. Reload the firewall to apply the new rules: # firewall-cmd --reload 3. Copy the DVD ISO image to the FTP server. 4. Create a suitable directory for mounting the DVD ISO image, for example: # mkdir /mnt/rhel9-install 5. Mount the DVD ISO image to the directory: # mount -o loop,ro -t iso9660 /image-directory/image.iso /mnt/rhel9-install Replace /image-directory/image.iso with the path to the DVD ISO image. 6. Copy the files from the mounted image to the FTP server root: # mkdir /var/ftp/rhel9-install # cp -r /mnt/rhel9-install/ /var/ftp/ This command creates the /var/ftp/rhel9-install/ directory with the content of the image. Note that some copying methods can skip the .treeinfo file which is required for a valid installation source.

NOTE When configuring the installation source, use ftp:// as the protocol, the server host name or IP address, and the directory in which you have stored the files from the ISO image, relative to the FTP server root. For example, if the server host name is myserver.example.com and you have copied the files from the image to /var/ftp/rhel9-install/, specify ftp://myserver.example.com/rhel9-install/ as the installation source. CHAPTER 6. CREATING INSTALLATION SOURCES FOR KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS 29 CHAPTER 7. INSTALLING RHEL ON ARM WITH KERNEL-64K By default, RHEL 9 is distributed with a kernel supporting a 4k page size. This 4k kernel is sufficient for efficient memory usage in smaller environments or small cloud instances where the usage of a 64k page kernel is not practical due to space, power, and cost constraints. IMPORTANT It is not recommended to move between 4k and 64k page size kernels after the initial boot without reinstallation of the OS. 7.1. INSTALLING KERNEL-64K ON ARM USING KICKSTART RHEL offers the ARM64 hardware architecture to support workloads that require large physical memory configuration for optimal performance.

INSTALLING KERNEL-64K ON ARM USING THE COMMAND LINE If you have already installed RHEL with the default kernel (supporting 4k page size), you can install kernel-64k post installation using the command line. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 30 Procedure 1. Open the terminal as the root user, and enter: # dnf -y install kernel-64k 2. To set the kernel-64k as default, enter: # k=$(echo /boot/vmlinuz*64k) # grubby --set-default=$k \\ --update-kernel=$k \\ --args=\"crashkernel=2G-:640M\" 3. Reboot the system: # reboot 4. Optional: After reboot, remove the 4k kernel: # dnf erase kernel Keeping both versions accidentally can make the 4k kernel default when you update the kernel in future using the yum update command.

CHAPTER 7. INSTALLING RHEL ON ARM WITH KERNEL-64K 31 CHAPTER 8. STARTING KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS You can start Kickstart installations in multiple ways: Manually by entering the installation program boot menu and specifying the options including Kickstart file there. Automatically by editing the boot options in PXE boot. Automatically by providing the file on a volume with specific name. Learn how to perform each of these methods in the following sections. 8.1. STARTING A KICKSTART INSTALLATION MANUALLY This section explains how to start a Kickstart installation manually, which means some user interaction is required (adding boot options at the boot: prompt). Use the boot option inst.ks=location when booting the installation system, replacing location with the location of your Kickstart file. The exact way to specify the boot option and the form of boot prompt depends on your system’s architecture. For detailed information, see the Boot options for RHEL installer guide. Prerequisites You have a Kickstart file ready in a location accessible from the system to be installed. Procedure 1. Boot the system using a local media (a CD, DVD, or a USB flash drive). 2. At the boot prompt, specify the required boot options. a. If the Kickstart file or a required repository is in a network location, you may need to configure the network using the ip= option. The installer tries to configure all network devices using the DHCP protocol by default without this option. b. Add the inst.ks= boot option and the location of the Kickstart file. c. In order to access a software source from which necessary packages will be installed, you may need to add the inst.repo= option.

Start the installation by confirming your added boot options. The installation begins now, using the options specified in the Kickstart file. If the Kickstart file is valid and contains all required commands, the installation is completely automated from this point forward. NOTE If you have installed a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta release, on systems having UEFI Secure Boot enabled, then add the Beta public key to the system’s Machine Owner Key (MOK) list. 8.2. STARTING A KICKSTART INSTALLATION AUTOMATICALLY USING PXE Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 32 AMD64, Intel 64, and 64-bit ARM systems and IBM Power Systems servers have the ability to boot using a PXE server. When you configure the PXE server, you can add the boot option into the boot loader configuration file, which in turn lets you start the installation automatically. Using this approach, it is possible to automate the installation completely, including the boot process. This procedure is intended as a general reference; detailed steps differ based on your system’s architecture, and not all options are available on all architectures (for example, you cannot use PXE boot on 64-bit IBM Z). Prerequisites You have a Kickstart file ready in a location accessible from the system to be installed. You have a PXE server that can be used to boot the system and begin the installation. Procedure 1. Open the boot loader configuration file on your PXE server, and add the inst.ks= boot option to the appropriate line. The name of the file and its syntax depends on your system’s architecture and hardware: On AMD64 and Intel 64 systems with BIOS, the file name can be either default or based on your system’s IP address. In this case, add the inst.ks= option to the append line in the installation entry.

Boot the installation from the network server. The installation begins now, using the installation options specified in the Kickstart file. If the Kickstart file is valid and contains all required commands, the installation is completely automated. NOTE If you have installed a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta release, on systems having UEFI Secure Boot enabled, then add the Beta public key to the system’s Machine Owner Key (MOK) list. 8.3. STARTING A KICKSTART INSTALLATION AUTOMATICALLY USING A LOCAL VOLUME You can start a Kickstart installation by putting a Kickstart file with a specific name on a specifically labelled storage volume. Prerequisites CHAPTER 8. STARTING KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS 33 Prerequisites You have a volume prepared with label OEMDRV and the Kickstart file present in its root as ks.cfg. A drive containing this volume is available on the system as the installation program boots. Procedure 1. Boot the system using a local media (a CD, DVD, or a USB flash drive). 2. At the boot prompt, specify the required boot options. a. If a required repository is in a network location, you may need to configure the network using the ip= option. The installer tries to configure all network devices using the DHCP protocol by default without this option. b. In order to access a software source from which necessary packages will be installed, you may need to add the inst.repo= option. If you do not specify this option, you must specify the installation source in the Kickstart file.

Kickstart installation. NOTE If you have installed a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta release, on systems having UEFI Secure Boot enabled, then add the Beta public key to the system’s Machine Owner Key (MOK) list. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 34 CHAPTER 9. CONSOLES AND LOGGING DURING INSTALLATION The Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer uses the tmux terminal multiplexer to display and control several windows in addition to the main interface. Each of these windows serve a different purpose; they display several different logs, which can be used to troubleshoot issues during the installation process. One of the windows provides an interactive shell prompt with root privileges, unless this prompt was specifically disabled using a boot option or a Kickstart command. NOTE In general, there is no reason to leave the default graphical installation environment unless you need to diagnose an installation problem. The terminal multiplexer is running in virtual console 1. To switch from the actual installation environment to tmux, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. To go back to the main installation interface which runs in virtual console 6, press Ctrl+Alt+F6. NOTE If you choose text mode installation, you will start in virtual console 1 (tmux), and switching to console 6 will open a shell prompt instead of a graphical interface. The console running tmux has five available windows; their contents are described in the following table, along with keyboard shortcuts. Note that the keyboard shortcuts are two-part: first press Ctrl+b, then release both keys, and press the number key for the window you want to use. You can also use Ctrl+b n, Alt+ Tab, and Ctrl+b p to switch to the next or previous tmux window, respectively. Table 9.1. Available tmux windows ShortcutContents Ctrl+b 1Main installation program window. Contains text- based prompts (during text mode installation or if you use VNC direct mode), and also some debugging information. Ctrl+b 2Interactive shell prompt with root privileges.

MAINTAINING KICKSTART FILES You can run automated checks on Kickstart files. Typically, you will want to verify that a new or problematic Kickstart file is valid. 10.1. INSTALLING KICKSTART MAINTENANCE TOOLS To use the Kickstart maintenance tools, you must install the package that contains them. Procedure Install the pykickstart package: # dnf install pykickstart 10.2. VERIFYING A KICKSTART FILE Use the ksvalidator command line utility to verify that your Kickstart file is valid. This is useful when you make extensive changes to a Kickstart file. Use the -v RHEL9 option in the ksvalidator command to acknowledge new commands of the RHEL9 class. Procedure Run ksvalidator on your Kickstart file: $ ksvalidator -v RHEL9 /path/to/kickstart.ks Replace /path/to/kickstart.ks with the path to the Kickstart file you want to verify. IMPORTANT The validation tool cannot guarantee the installation will be successful. It ensures only that the syntax is correct and that the file does not include deprecated options. It does not attempt to validate the %pre, %post and %packages sections of the Kickstart file.

this procedure to register your system, attach RHEL subscriptions, and install from the Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) using the rhsm Kickstart command, which supports the syspurpose command as well as Red Hat Insights. The rhsm Kickstart command removes the requirement of using custom %post scripts when registering the system. IMPORTANT The CDN feature is supported by the Boot ISO and DVD ISO image files. However, it is recommended that you use the Boot ISO image file as the installation source defaults to CDN for the Boot ISO image file. Prerequisites Your system is connected to a network that can access the CDN. You have created a Kickstart file and made it available to the installation program on removable media, a hard drive, or a network location using an HTTP(S), FTP, or NFS server. The Kickstart file is in a location that is accessible by the system that is to be installed. You have created the boot media used to begin the installation and made the installation source available to the installation program. IMPORTANT The installation source repository used after system registration is dependent on how the system was booted. For more information, see the Installation source repository after system registration section in the Performing a standard RHEL 9 installation document. Repository configuration is not required in a Kickstart file as your subscription governs which CDN subset and repositories the system can access. Procedure 1. Open the Kickstart file. 2. Edit the file to add the rhsm Kickstart command and its options to the file: Organization (required) Enter the organization id. An example is: --organization=1234567 NOTE Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 38 NOTE For security reasons, Red Hat username and password account details are not supported by Kickstart when registering and installing from the CDN. Activation Key (required) Enter the Activation Key. You can enter multiple keys as long as the activation keys are registered to your subscription.

REGISTERING AND INSTALLING RHEL FROM SATELLITE USING KICKSTART This section contains information about how to register your system, attach RHEL subscriptions, and install from the Red Hat Satellite using Kickstart. 12.1. REGISTERING AND INSTALLING RHEL FROM SATELLITE This procedure describes how to register your system, attach RHEL subscriptions, and install from a Satellite instance using the rhsm Kickstart command. It also shows how to configure system purpose and connect the system to Red Hat Insights. The rhsm Kickstart command removes the requirement of using custom %post scripts when registering the system. IMPORTANT Satellite installation is supported by the Boot ISO and DVD ISO image files.

installation source repository used after system registration is dependent on how the system was booted. For more information, see the Installation source repository after the system registration. Repository configuration is not required in a Kickstart file as your subscription governs which satellite hosted repositories the system can access. Prerequisites Your system is connected to a network that can access the Satellite instance. The Red Hat Satellite Server version is 6.11 or later You have created a Kickstart file and made it available to the installation program on removable media, a hard drive, or a network location using an HTTP(S), FTP, or NFS server. The Kickstart file is in a location that is accessible by the system that is to be installed. You have an organization ID, activation key, and the URL of the Satellite 6.11 instance you want to use. You have enabled, synced, and added the required BaseOS and AppStream RPMs repositories to the content-view. The activation key has the release version set to 9.x, and the concerned content-view is selected in it. Procedure 1. Open the Kickstart file. 2. Edit the file to add the rhsm Kickstart command and its options to the file: Organization (required) Enter the organization id. An example is: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 42 --organization=1234567 NOTE For security reasons, Red Hat username and password account details are not supported by Kickstart when registering and installing from the satellite. Activation Key (required) Enter the Activation Key. You can enter multiple keys as long as the activation keys are registered to your subscription. An example is: --activation-key=\"Test_key_1\" --activation-key=\"Test_key_2\" Red Hat Insights (optional) Connect the target system to Red Hat Insights. NOTE Red Hat Insights is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering that provides continuous, in-depth analysis of registered Red Hat-based systems to proactively identify threats to security, performance and stability across physical, virtual and cloud environments, and container deployments.

CONFIGURING SYSTEM PURPOSE IN A KICKSTART FILE Follow the steps in this procedure to configure System Purpose during the installation. To do so, use the syspurpose Kickstart command in the Kickstart configuration file. Even though System Purpose is an optional feature of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program, we strongly recommend that you configure System Purpose to auto-attach the most appropriate subscription. NOTE You can also enable System Purpose after the installation is complete. To do so use the subscription-manager command-line tool. The subscription-manager tool commands are different from the syspurpose Kickstart commands. The following actions are available for the syspurpose Kickstart command: role Set the intended role of the system. This action uses the following format: syspurpose --role= The assigned role can be: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation Red Hat Enterprise Linux Compute Node SLA Set the intended SLA of the system. This action uses the following format: syspurpose --sla= The assigned sla can be: Premium Standard Self-Support usage Set the intended usage of the system. This action uses the following format: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 48 syspurpose --usage= The assigned usage can be: Production Development/Test Disaster Recovery addon Any additional layered products or features. To add multiple items specify --addon multiple times, once per layered product/feature. This action uses the following format: syspurpose --addon= 13.3.

Hat recommends that you do not perform a driver update unless it is necessary. Prerequisites You have been notified by Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third-party vendor that a driver update is required during Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation. 14.1. OVERVIEW Red Hat Enterprise Linux supports drivers for many hardware devices but some newly-released drivers may not be supported. A driver update should only be performed if an unsupported driver prevents the installation from completing. Updating drivers during installation is typically only required to support a particular configuration. For example, installing drivers for a storage adapter card that provides access to your system’s storage devices. WARNING Driver update disks may disable conflicting kernel drivers. In rare cases, unloading a kernel module may cause installation errors. 14.2. TYPES OF DRIVER UPDATE Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third party provides the driver update as an ISO image file. Once you receive the ISO image file, choose the type of driver update. Types of driver update Automatic The recommended driver update method; a storage device (including a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive) labeled OEMDRV is physically connected to the system. If the OEMDRV storage device is present when the installation starts, it is treated as a driver update disk, and the installation program automatically loads its drivers. Assisted The installation program prompts you to locate a driver update. You can use any local storage device with a label other than OEMDRV. The inst.dd boot option is specified when starting the installation. If you use this option without any parameters, the installation program displays all of the storage devices connected to the system, and prompts you to select a device that contains a driver update. Manual Manually specify a path to a driver update image or an RPM package. You can use any local storage  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 50 device with a label other than OEMDRV, or a network location accessible from the installation system. The inst.dd=location boot option is specified when starting the installation, where location is the path to a driver update disk or ISO image.

to load any driver updates found at the specified location. With manual driver updates, you can specify local storage devices, or a network location (HTTP, HTTPS or FTP server). NOTE You can use both inst.dd=location and inst.dd simultaneously, where location is the path to a driver update disk or ISO image. In this scenario, the installation program attempts to load any available driver updates from the location and also prompts you to select a device that contains the driver update. Limitations On UEFI systems with the Secure Boot technology enabled, all drivers must be signed with a valid certificate. Red Hat drivers are signed by one of Red Hat’s private keys and authenticated by its corresponding public key in the kernel. If you load additional, separate drivers, verify that they are signed. 14.3. PREPARING A DRIVER UPDATE This procedure describes how to prepare a driver update on a CD and DVD. Prerequisites You have received the driver update ISO image from Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third-party vendor. You have burned the driver update ISO image to a CD or DVD. WARNING If only a single ISO image file ending in .iso is available on the CD or DVD, the burn process has not been successful. See your system’s burning software documentation for instructions on how to burn ISO images to a CD or DVD. Procedure 1. Insert the driver update CD or DVD into your system’s CD/DVD drive, and browse it using the system’s file manager tool. 2. Verify that a single file rhdd3 is available. rhdd3 is a signature file that contains the driver description and a directory named rpms, which contains the RPM packages with the actual drivers for various architectures. 14.4. PERFORMING AN AUTOMATIC DRIVER UPDATE This procedure describes how to perform an automatic driver update during installation.  CHAPTER 14. UPDATING DRIVERS DURING INSTALLATION 51 Prerequisites You have placed the driver update image on a standard disk partition with an OEMDRV label or burnt the OEMDRV driver update image to a CD or DVD.

have connected a block device with an OEMDRV volume label to your system, or inserted the prepared CD or DVD into your system’s CD/DVD drive before starting the installation process. Procedure When you complete the prerequisite steps, the drivers load automatically when the installation program starts and installs during the system’s installation process. 14.5. PERFORMING AN ASSISTED DRIVER UPDATE This procedure describes how to perform an assisted driver update during installation. Prerequisites You have connected a block device without an OEMDRV volume label to your system and copied the driver disk image to this device, or you have prepared a driver update CD or DVD and inserted it into your system’s CD or DVD drive before starting the installation process. NOTE If you burned an ISO image file to a CD or DVD but it does not have the OEMDRV volume label, you can use the inst.dd option with no arguments. The installation program provides an option to scan and select drivers from the CD or DVD. In this scenario, the installation program does not prompt you to select a driver update ISO image. Another scenario is to use the CD or DVD with the inst.dd=location boot option; this allows the installation program to automatically scan the CD or DVD for driver updates. For more information, see Performing a manual driver update. Procedure 1. From the boot menu window, press the Tab key on your keyboard to display the boot command line. 2. Append the inst.dd boot option to the command line and press Enter to execute the boot process. 3. From the menu, select a local disk partition or a CD or DVD device. The installation program scans for ISO files, or driver update RPM packages. 4. Optional: Select the driver update ISO file. NOTE This step is not required if the selected device or partition contains driver update RPM packages rather than an ISO image file, for example, an optical drive containing a driver update CD or DVD.

15.1. UEFI SECURE BOOT AND RHEL BETA RELEASES UEFI Secure Boot requires that the operating system kernel is signed with a recognized private key. UEFI Secure Boot then verifies the signature using the corresponding public key. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta releases, the kernel is signed with a Red Hat Beta-specific private key. UEFI Secure Boot attempts to verify the signature using the corresponding public key, but because the hardware does not recognize the Beta private key, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta release system fails to boot. Therefore, to use UEFI Secure Boot with a Beta release, add the Red Hat Beta public key to your system using the Machine Owner Key (MOK) facility. 15.2. ADDING A BETA PUBLIC KEY FOR UEFI SECURE BOOT This section contains information about how to add a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta public key for UEFI Secure Boot. Prerequisites The UEFI Secure Boot is disabled on the system. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta release is installed, and Secure Boot is disabled even after system reboot. You are logged in to the system, and the tasks in the Initial Setup window are complete. Procedure 1. Begin to enroll the Red Hat Beta public key in the system’s Machine Owner Key (MOK) list: # mokutil --import /usr/share/doc/kernel-keys/$(uname -r)/kernel-signing-ca.cer $(uname -r) is replaced by the kernel version - for example, 4.18.0-80.el8.x86_64. 2. Enter a password when prompted. 3. Reboot the system and press any key to continue the startup. The Shim UEFI key management utility starts during the system startup. 4. Select Enroll MOK. 5. Select Continue. 6. Select Yes and enter the password. The key is imported into the system’s firmware. 7. Select Reboot. 8. Enable Secure Boot on the system. CHAPTER 15.

KICKSTART FILE FORMAT Kickstart scripts are plain text files that contain keywords recognized by the installation program, which serve as directions for the installation. Any text editor able to save files as ASCII text, such as Gedit or vim on Linux systems or Notepad on Windows systems, can be used to create and edit Kickstart files. The file name of your Kickstart configuration does not matter; however, it is recommended to use a simple name as you will need to specify this name later in other configuration files or dialogs. Commands Commands are keywords that serve as directions for installation. Each command must be on a single line. Commands can take options. Specifying commands and options is similar to using Linux commands in shell. Sections Certain special commands that begin with the percent % character start a section. Interpretation of commands in sections is different from commands placed outside sections. Every section must be finished with %end command. Section types The available sections are: Add-on sections.

selection sections. Starts with %packages. Use it to list packages for installation, including indirect means such as package groups or modules. Script sections. These start with %pre, %pre-install, %post, and %onerror. These sections are not required. Command section The command section is a term used for the commands in the Kickstart file that are not part of any script section or %packages section. Script section count and ordering All sections except the command section are optional and can be present multiple times. When a particular type of script section is to be evaluated, all sections of that type present in the Kickstart are evaluated in order of appearance: two %post sections are evaluated one after another, in the order as they appear. However, you do not have to specify the various types of script sections in any order: it does not matter if there are %post sections before %pre sections. Comments Kickstart comments are lines starting with the hash # character. These lines are ignored by the installation program. Items that are not required can be omitted. Omitting any required item results in the installation program changing to the interactive mode so that the user can provide an answer to the related item, just as during a regular interactive installation. It is also possible to declare the kickstart script as non- interactive with the cmdline command. In non-interactive mode, any missing answer aborts the installation process. NOTE Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 58 NOTE If user interaction is needed during kickstart installation in text or graphical mode, enter only the windows where updates are mandatory to complete the installation. Entering spokes might lead to resetting the kickstart configuration. Resetting of the configuration applies specifically to the kickstart commands related to storage after entering the Installation Destination window. A.2. PACKAGE SELECTION IN KICKSTART Kickstart uses sections started by the %packages command for selecting packages to install. You can install packages, groups, environments, module streams, and module profiles this way. A.2.1.

The %packages section must end with the %end command. You can specify packages by environment, group, module stream, module profile, or by their package names. Several environments and groups that contain related packages are defined. See the repository/repodata/*-comps-repository.architecture.xml file on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Installation DVD for a list of environments and groups. The *-comps-repository.architecture.xml file contains a structure describing available environments (marked by the <environment> tag) and groups (the <group> tag). Each entry has an ID, user visibility value, name, description, and package list. If the group is selected for installation, the packages marked mandatory in the package list are always installed, the packages marked default are installed if they are not specifically excluded elsewhere, and the packages marked optional must be specifically included elsewhere even when the group is selected. You can specify a package group or environment using either its ID (the <id> tag) or name (the <name> tag). If you are not sure what package should be installed, Red Hat recommends you to select the Minimal Install environment. Minimal Install provides only the packages which are essential for running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. This will substantially reduce the chance of the system being affected by a vulnerability. If necessary, additional packages can be added later after the installation. For more details on Minimal Install, see the Installing the Minimum Amount of Packages Required section of the Security Hardening document. Note that Initial Setup can not run after a system is installed from a Kickstart file unless a desktop environment and the X Window System were included in the installation and graphical login was enabled. IMPORTANT To install a 32-bit package on a 64-bit system: specify the --multilib option for the %packages section append the package name with the 32-bit architecture for which the package was built; for example, glibc.i686 A.2.2.

@^Infrastructure Server %end This installs all packages which are part of the Infrastructure Server environment. All available environments are described in the repository/repodata/*-comps-repository.architecture.xml file on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Installation DVD. Only a single environment should be specified in the Kickstart file. If more environments are specified, only the last specified environment is used. Specifying groups Specify groups, one entry to a line, starting with an @ symbol, and then the full group name or group id as given in the *-comps-repository.architecture.xml file. For example: %packages @X Window System @Desktop @Sound and Video %end The Core group is always selected - it is not necessary to specify it in the %packages section. Specifying individual packages Specify individual packages by name, one entry to a line. You can use the asterisk character (*) as a wildcard in package names. For example: %packages sqlite curl aspell docbook* %end The docbook* entry includes the packages docbook-dtds and docbook-style that match the pattern represented with the wildcard. Specifying profiles of module streams Specify profiles for module streams, one entry to a line, using the syntax for profiles: %packages @module:stream/profile %end This installs all packages listed in the specified profile of the module stream. When a module has a default stream specified, you can leave it out. When the default stream is not specified, you must specify it. When a module stream has a default profile specified, you can leave it out.

Installing multiple profiles of the same module and stream is possible. Modules and groups use the same syntax starting with the @ symbol.

list available modules, use the dnf module list command on an installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 system. It is also possible to enable module streams using the module Kickstart command and then install packages contained in the module stream by naming them directly. Excluding environments, groups, or packages Use a leading dash (-) to specify packages or groups to exclude from the installation. For example: %packages -@Graphical Administration Tools -autofs -ipa*compat %end IMPORTANT Installing all available packages using only * in a Kickstart file is not supported. You can change the default behavior of the %packages section by using several options. Some options work for the entire package selection, others are used with only specific groups. Additional resources Managing Software with the DNF Tool A.2.3. Common package selection options The following options are available for the %packages sections. To use an option, append it to the start of the package selection section. For example: %packages --multilib --ignoremissing --default Install the default set of packages. This corresponds to the package set which would be installed if no other selections were made in the Package Selection screen during an interactive installation. --excludedocs Do not install any documentation contained within packages. In most cases, this excludes any files normally installed in the /usr/share/doc directory, but the specific files to be excluded depend on individual packages. APPENDIX A. KICKSTART SCRIPT FILE FORMAT REFERENCE 61 --ignoremissing Ignore any packages, groups, module streams, module profiles, and environments missing in the installation source, instead of halting the installation to ask if the installation should be aborted or continued. --inst-langs Specify a list of languages to install. Note that this is different from package group level selections. This option does not describe which package groups should be installed; instead, it sets RPM macros controlling which translation files from individual packages should be installed. --multilib Configure the installed system for multilib packages, to allow installing 32-bit packages on a 64-bit system, and install packages specified in this section as such.

However, with the --multilib option, you can automatically install the 32-bit AMD and the i686 Intel system packages available, if any. This only applies to packages explicitly specified in the %packages section. Packages which are only being installed as dependencies without being specified in the Kickstart file are only installed in architecture versions in which they are needed, even if they are available for more architectures. User can configure Anaconda to install packages in multilib mode during the installation of the system. Use one of the following options to enable multilib mode: 1. Configure Kickstart file with the following lines: %packages --multilib --default %end 2. Add the inst.multilib boot option during booting the installation image. --nocore Disables installation of the @Core package group which is otherwise always installed by default. Disabling the @Core package group with --nocore should be only used for creating lightweight containers; installing a desktop or server system with --nocore will result in an unusable system. NOTES Using -@Core to exclude packages in the @Core package group does not work. The only way to exclude the @Core package group is with the --nocore option. The @Core package group is defined as a minimal set of packages needed for installing a working system. It is not related in any way to core packages as defined in the Package Manifest and Scope of Coverage Details. --exclude-weakdeps Disables installation of packages from weak dependencies. These are packages linked to the selected package set by Recommends and Supplements flags. By default weak dependencies will be installed. --retries= Sets the number of times DNF will attempt to download packages (retries). The default value is 10. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 62 Sets the number of times DNF will attempt to download packages (retries). The default value is 10. This option only applies during the installation, and will not affect DNF configuration on the installed system. --timeout= Sets the DNF timeout in seconds. The default value is 30.

Options for specific package groups The options in this list only apply to a single package group. Instead of using them at the %packages command in the Kickstart file, append them to the group name. For example: %packages @Graphical Administration Tools --optional %end --nodefaults Only install the group’s mandatory packages, not the default selections. --optional Install packages marked as optional in the group definition in the *- comps-repository.architecture.xml file, in addition to installing the default selections. Note that some package groups, such as Scientific Support, do not have any mandatory or default packages specified - only optional packages. In this case the --optional option must always be used, otherwise no packages from this group will be installed. IMPORTANT The --nodefaults and --optional options cannot be used together. You can install only mandatory packages during the installation using --nodefaults and install the optional packages on the installed system post installation. A.3. SCRIPTS IN KICKSTART FILE A kickstart file can include the following scripts: %pre %pre-install %post This section provides the following details about the scripts: Execution time Types of commands that can be included in the script Purpose of the script Script options A.3.1. %pre script APPENDIX A. KICKSTART SCRIPT FILE FORMAT REFERENCE 63 The %pre scripts are run on the system immediately after the Kickstart file has been loaded, but before it is completely parsed and installation begins. Each of these sections must start with %pre and end with %end. The %pre script can be used for activation and configuration of networking and storage devices. It is also possible to run scripts, using interpreters available in the installation environment. Adding a %pre script can be useful if you have networking and storage that needs special configuration before proceeding with the installation, or have a script that, for example, sets up additional logging parameters or environment variables.

The %pre section of Kickstart is executed at the stage of installation which happens after the installer image (inst.stage2) is fetched: it means after root switches to the installer environment (the installer image) and after the Anaconda installer itself starts. Then the configuration in %pre is applied and can be used to fetch packages from installation repositories configured, for example, by URL in Kickstart. However, it cannot be used to configure network to fetch the image (inst.stage2) from network. Commands related to networking, storage, and file systems are available to use in the %pre script, in addition to most of the utilities in the installation environment /sbin and /bin directories. You can access the network in the %pre section. However, the name service has not been configured at this point, so only IP addresses work, not URLs. NOTE The pre script does not run in the chroot environment. A.3.1.1. %pre script section options The following options can be used to change the behavior of pre-installation scripts. To use an option, append it to the %pre line at the beginning of the script. For example: %pre --interpreter=/usr/libexec/platform-python -- Python script omitted -- %end --interpreter= Allows you to specify a different scripting language, such as Python. Any scripting language available on the system can be used; in most cases, these are /usr/bin/sh, /usr/bin/bash, and /usr/libexec/platform-python. Note that the platform-python interpreter uses Python version 3.6. You must change your Python scripts from previous RHEL versions for the new path and version. Additionally, platform-python is meant for system tools: Use the python36 package outside the installation environment. For more details about Python in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see\\ Introduction to Python in Installing and using dynamic programming languages. --erroronfail Displays an error and halts the installation if the script fails. The error message will direct you to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 64 Displays an error and halts the installation if the script fails.

installed system might get into an unstable and unbootable state. You can use the inst.nokill option to debug the script. --log= Logs the script’s output into the specified log file. For example: %pre --log=/tmp/ks-pre.log A.3.2. %pre-install script The commands in the pre-install script are run after the following tasks are complete: System is partitioned Filesystems are created and mounted under /mnt/sysroot Network has been configured according to any boot options and kickstart commands Each of the %pre-install sections must start with %pre-install and end with %end. The %pre-install scripts can be used to modify the installation, and to add users and groups with guaranteed IDs before package installation. It is recommended to use the %post scripts for any modifications required in the installation. Use the %pre-install script only if the %post script falls short for the required modifications. Note: The pre-install script does not run in chroot environment. A.3.2.1. %pre-install script section options The following options can be used to change the behavior of pre-install scripts. To use an option, append it to the %pre-install line at the beginning of the script. For example: %pre-install --interpreter=/usr/libexec/platform-python -- Python script omitted -- %end Note that you can have multiple %pre-install sections, with same or different interpreters. They are evaluated in their order of appearance in the Kickstart file. --interpreter= Allows you to specify a different scripting language, such as Python. Any scripting language available on the system can be used; in most cases, these are /usr/bin/sh, /usr/bin/bash, and /usr/libexec/platform-python. Note that the platform-python interpreter uses Python version 3.6. You must change your Python scripts from previous RHEL versions for the new path and version. Additionally, platform-python is meant for system tools: Use the python36 package outside the installation environment.

error message will direct you to APPENDIX A. KICKSTART SCRIPT FILE FORMAT REFERENCE 65 Displays an error and halts the installation if the script fails. The error message will direct you to where the cause of the failure is logged. The installed system might get into an unstable and unbootable state. You can use the inst.nokill option to debug the script. --log= Logs the script’s output into the specified log file. For example: %pre-install --log=/mnt/sysroot/root/ks-pre.log A.3.3. %post script The %post script is a post-installation script that is run after the installation is complete, but before the system is rebooted for the first time. You can use this section to run tasks such as system subscription. You have the option of adding commands to run on the system once the installation is complete, but before the system is rebooted for the first time. This section must start with %post and end with %end. The %post section is useful for functions such as installing additional software or configuring an additional name server. The post-install script is run in a chroot environment, therefore, performing tasks such as copying scripts or RPM packages from the installation media do not work by default. You can change this behavior using the --nochroot option as described below. Then the %post script will run in the installation environment, not in chroot on the installed target system. Because post-install script runs in a chroot environment, most systemctl commands will refuse to perform any action. Note that during execution of the %post section, the installation media must be still inserted. A.3.3.1. %post script section options The following options can be used to change the behavior of post-installation scripts. To use an option, append it to the %post line at the beginning of the script.

and /usr/libexec/platform-python. Note that the platform-python interpreter uses Python version 3.6. You must change your Python scripts from previous RHEL versions for the new path and version. Additionally, platform-python is meant for system tools: Use the python36 package outside the installation environment. For more details about Python in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see Introduction to Python in Installing and using dynamic programming languages. --nochroot Allows you to specify commands that you would like to run outside of the chroot environment. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 66 The following example copies the file /etc/resolv.conf to the file system that was just installed. %post --nochroot cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/sysroot/etc/resolv.conf %end --erroronfail Displays an error and halts the installation if the script fails. The error message will direct you to where the cause of the failure is logged. The installed system might get into an unstable and unbootable state. You can use the inst.nokill option to debug the script. --log= Logs the script’s output into the specified log file. Note that the path of the log file must take into account whether or not you use the --nochroot option. For example, without --nochroot: %post --log=/root/ks-post.log and with --nochroot: %post --nochroot --log=/mnt/sysroot/root/ks-post.log A.3.3.2. Example: Mounting NFS in a post-install script This example of a %post section mounts an NFS share and executes a script named runme located at /usr/new-machines/ on the share.

End of the %post section %end A.4. KICKSTART ERROR HANDLING SECTION Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Kickstart installations can contain custom scripts which are run when the installation program encounters a fatal error. For example, an error in a package that has been requested for installation, failure to start VNC when specified, or an error when scanning storage devices. Installation cannot continue after such an error has occured. The installation program will run all %onerror scripts in the order they are provided in the Kickstart file. In addition, %onerror scripts will be run in the event of a traceback. Each %onerror script is required to end with %end. Error handling sections accept the following options: APPENDIX A. KICKSTART SCRIPT FILE FORMAT REFERENCE 67 --erroronfail Displays an error and halts the installation if the script fails. The error message will direct you to where the cause of the failure is logged. The installed system might get into an unstable and unbootable state. You can use the inst.nokill option to debug the script. --interpreter= Allows you to specify a different scripting language, such as Python. For example: %onerror --interpreter=/usr/libexec/platform-python Any scripting language available on the system can be used; in most cases, these are /usr/bin/sh, /usr/bin/bash, and /usr/libexec/platform-python. Note that the platform-python interpreter uses Python version 3.6. You must change your Python scripts from previous RHEL versions for the new path and version. Additionally, platform-python is meant for system tools: Use the python36 package outside the installation environment. For more details about Python in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see Introduction to Python in Installing and using dynamic programming languages. --log= Logs the script’s output into the specified log file. A.5. KICKSTART ADD-ON SECTIONS Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Kickstart installations support add-ons.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 68 APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE This reference is a complete list of all Kickstart commands supported by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program program. The commands are sorted alphabetically in a few broad categories. If a command can fall under multiple categories, it is listed in all of them. B.1. KICKSTART CHANGES The following sections describe the changes in Kickstart commands and options in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. B.1.1. auth or authconfig is deprecated in RHEL 8 The auth or authconfig Kickstart command is deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because the authconfig tool and package have been removed. Similarly to authconfig commands issued on command line, authconfig commands in Kickstart scripts now use the authselect-compat tool to run the new authselect tool. For a description of this compatibility layer and its known issues, see the manual page authselect-migration(7). The installation program will automatically detect use of the deprecated commands and install on the system the authselect-compat package to provide the compatibility layer. B.1.2. Using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases If you are using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases, see the Repositories section of the Considerations in adopting RHEL 8 document for more information about the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 BaseOS and AppStream repositories. B.1.3.

the system will use graphical mode if possible, or prompt you to choose from VNC and text mode. This command has no options. This mode is useful on 64-bit IBM Z systems with the x3270 terminal. B.2.3. driverdisk The driverdisk Kickstart command is optional. Use it to provide additional drivers to the installation program. Driver disks can be used during Kickstart installations to provide additional drivers not included by default. You must copy the driver disks contents to the root directory of a partition on the system’s hard drive. Then, you must use the driverdisk command to specify that the installation program should look for a driver disk and its location. Syntax driverdisk [partition|--source=url|--biospart=biospart] Options You must specify the location of driver disk in one way out of these: partition - Partition containing the driver disk. Note that the partition must be specified as a full path (for example, /dev/sdb1), not just the partition name (for example, sdb1). --source= - URL for the driver disk. Examples include: driverdisk --source=ftp://path/to/dd.img driverdisk --source=http://path/to/dd.img driverdisk --source=nfs:host:/path/to/dd.img --biospart= - BIOS partition containing the driver disk (for example, 82p2). Notes Driver disks can also be loaded from a hard disk drive or a similar device instead of being loaded over the network or from initrd. Follow this procedure: 1. Load the driver disk on a hard disk drive, a USB or any similar device. 2. Set the label, for example, DD, to this device. 3. Add the following line to your Kickstart file: driverdisk LABEL=DD:/e1000.rpm APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 71 Replace DD with a specific label and replace e1000.rpm with a specific name. Use anything supported by the inst.repo command instead of LABEL to specify your hard disk drive. B.2.4. eula The eula Kickstart command is optional.

without user interaction. Specifying this option prevents Initial Setup from prompting you to accept the license agreement after you finish the installation and reboot the system for the first time. Syntax eula [--agreed] Options --agreed (required) - Accept the EULA. This option must always be used, otherwise the eula command is meaningless. B.2.5. firstboot The firstboot Kickstart command is optional. It determines whether the Initial Setup application starts the first time the system is booted. If enabled, the initial-setup package must be installed. If not specified, this option is disabled by default. Syntax firstboot OPTIONS Options --enable or --enabled - Initial Setup is started the first time the system boots. --disable or --disabled - Initial Setup is not started the first time the system boots. --reconfig - Enable the Initial Setup to start at boot time in reconfiguration mode. This mode enables the root password, time & date, and networking & host name configuration options in addition to the default ones. B.2.6. graphical The graphical Kickstart command is optional. It performs the installation in graphical mode. This is the default. Syntax graphical [--non-interactive] Options --non-interactive - Performs the installation in a completely non-interactive mode. This mode will terminate the installation when user interaction is required. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 72 Notes For a fully automatic installation, you must either specify one of the available modes (graphical, text, or cmdline) in the Kickstart file, or you must use the console= boot option. If no mode is specified, the system will use graphical mode if possible, or prompt you to choose from VNC and text mode. B.2.7. halt The halt Kickstart command is optional. Halt the system after the installation has successfully completed. This is similar to a manual installation, where Anaconda displays a message and waits for the user to press a key before rebooting.

halt Notes The halt command is equivalent to the shutdown -H command. For more details, see the shutdown(8) man page. For other completion methods, see the poweroff, reboot, and shutdown commands. This command has no options. B.2.8. harddrive The harddrive Kickstart command is optional. It performs the installation from a Red Hat installation tree or full installation ISO image on a local drive. The drive must be formatted with a file system the installation program can mount: ext2, ext3, ext4, vfat, or xfs. Syntax harddrive OPTIONS Options --partition= - Partition to install from (such as sdb2). --dir= - Directory containing the variant directory of the installation tree, or the ISO image of the full installation DVD. Example harddrive --partition=hdb2 --dir=/tmp/install-tree Notes Previously, the harddrive command had to be used together with the install command. The APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 73 Previously, the harddrive command had to be used together with the install command. The install command has been deprecated and harddrive can be used on its own, because it implies install. To actually run the installation, you must specify one of cdrom, harddrive, hmc, nfs, liveimg, ostreesetup, rhsm, or url unless the inst.repo option is specified on the kernel command line. B.2.9. liveimg The liveimg Kickstart command is optional. It performs the installation from a disk image instead of packages. Syntax liveimg --url=SOURCE [OPTIONS] Mandatory options --url= - The location to install from. Supported protocols are HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and file. Optional options --url= - The location to install from.

ISO image, a compressed tar file (.tar, .tbz, .tgz, .txz, .tar.bz2, .tar.gz, or .tar.xz.), or any file system that the installation media can mount. Supported file systems are ext2, ext3, ext4, vfat, and xfs. When using the liveimg installation mode with a driver disk, drivers on the disk will not automatically be included in the installed system. If necessary, these drivers should be installed manually, or in the %post section of a kickstart script. To actually run the installation, you must specify one of cdrom, harddrive, hmc, nfs, liveimg, ostreesetup, rhsm, or url unless the inst.repo option is specified on the kernel command line. B.2.10. logging The logging Kickstart command is optional. It controls the error logging of Anaconda during installation. It has no effect on the installed system. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 74 NOTE Logging is supported over TCP only. For remote logging, ensure that the port number that you specify in --port= option is open on the remote server. The default port is 514. Syntax logging OPTIONS Optional options --host= - Send logging information to the given remote host, which must be running a syslogd process configured to accept remote logging. --port= - If the remote syslogd process uses a port other than the default, set it using this option. B.2.11. mediacheck The mediacheck Kickstart command is optional. This command forces the installation program to perform a media check before starting the installation. This command requires that installations be attended, so it is disabled by default. Syntax mediacheck Notes This Kickstart command is equivalent to the rd.live.check boot option.

Syntax nfs OPTIONS Options --server= - Server from which to install (host name or IP). --dir= - Directory containing the variant directory of the installation tree. --opts= - Mount options to use for mounting the NFS export. (optional) Example nfs --server=nfsserver.example.com --dir=/tmp/install-tree APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 75 Notes To actually run the installation, you must specify one of cdrom, harddrive, hmc, nfs, liveimg, ostreesetup, rhsm, or url unless the inst.repo option is specified on the kernel command line. B.2.13. ostreesetup The ostreesetup Kickstart command is optional. It is used to set up OStree-based installations. Syntax ostreesetup --osname=OSNAME [--remote=REMOTE] --url=URL --ref=REF [--nogpg] Mandatory options: --osname=OSNAME - Management root for OS installation. --url=URL - URL of the repository to install from. --ref=REF - Name of the branch from the repository to be used for installation.

file. The poweroff command is highly dependent on the system hardware in use. Specifically, certain hardware components such as the BIOS, APM (advanced power management), and ACPI (advanced configuration and power interface) must be able to interact with the system kernel. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 76 Consult your hardware documentation for more information about you system’s APM/ACPI abilities. This command has no options. B.2.15. reboot The reboot Kickstart command is optional. It instructs the installation program to reboot after the installation is successfully completed (no arguments). Normally, Kickstart displays a message and waits for the user to press a key before rebooting. Syntax reboot OPTIONS Options --eject - Attempt to eject the bootable media (DVD, USB, or other media) before rebooting. --kexec - Uses the kexec system call instead of performing a full reboot, which immediately loads the installed system into memory, bypassing the hardware initialization normally performed by the BIOS or firmware. IMPORTANT This option is deprecated and available as a Technology Preview only. For information about Red Hat scope of support for Technology Preview features, see the Technology Preview Features Support Scope document. When kexec is used, device registers (which would normally be cleared during a full system reboot) might stay filled with data, which could potentially create issues for some device drivers. Notes Use of the reboot option might result in an endless installation loop, depending on the installation media and method. The reboot option is equivalent to the shutdown -r command. For more details, see the shutdown(8) man page. Specify reboot to automate installation fully when installing in command line mode on 64-bit IBM Z. For other completion methods, see the halt, poweroff, and shutdown Kickstart options. The halt option is the default completion method if no other methods are explicitly specified in the Kickstart file. B.2.16. rhsm The rhsm Kickstart command is optional.

NOTE The rhsm Kickstart command removes the requirement of using custom %post scripts when registering the system. Options --organization= - Uses the organization id to register and install RHEL from the CDN. --activation-key= - Uses the activation key to register and install RHEL from the CDN. Option can be used multiple times, once per activation key, as long as the activation keys used are registered to your subscription. --connect-to-insights - Connects the target system to Red Hat Insights. --proxy= - Sets the HTTP proxy. --server-hostname= - Sets the Satellite instance hostname for registration. To switch the installation source repository to the CDN by using the rhsm Kickstart command, you must meet the following conditions: On the kernel command line, you have used inst.stage2=<URL> to fetch the installation image but have not specified an installation source using inst.repo=. In the Kickstart file, you have not specified an installation source by using the url, cdrom, harddrive, liveimg, nfs and ostree setup commands. An installation source URL specified using a boot option or included in a Kickstart file takes precedence over the CDN, even if the Kickstart file contains the rhsm command with valid credentials. The system is registered, but it is installed from the URL installation source. This ensures that earlier installation processes operate as normal. B.2.17. shutdown The shutdown Kickstart command is optional. It shuts down the system after the installation has successfully completed. Syntax shutdown Notes The shutdown Kickstart option is equivalent to the shutdown command. For more details, see the shutdown(8) man page. For other completion methods, see the halt, poweroff, and reboot Kickstart options. The halt option is the default completion method if no other methods are explicitly specified in the Kickstart file. This command has no options.

the sshpw command to create temporary accounts through which to log on. Each instance of the command creates a separate account that exists only in the installation environment. These accounts are not transferred to the installed system. Syntax sshpw --username=name [OPTIONS] password Mandatory options --username=name - Provides the name of the user. This option is required. password - The password to use for the user. This option is required. Optional options --iscrypted - If this option is present, the password argument is assumed to already be encrypted. This option is mutually exclusive with --plaintext. To create an encrypted password, you can use Python: $ python3 -c 'import crypt,getpass;pw=getpass.getpass();print(crypt.crypt(pw) if (pw==getpass.getpass(\"Confirm: \")) else exit())' This generates a sha512 crypt-compatible hash of your password using a random salt. --plaintext - If this option is present, the password argument is assumed to be in plain text. This option is mutually exclusive with --iscrypted --lock - If this option is present, this account is locked by default. This means that the user will not be able to log in from the console. --sshkey - If this is option is present, then the <password> string is interpreted as an ssh key value. Notes By default, the ssh server is not started during the installation. To make ssh available during the installation, boot the system with the kernel boot option inst.sshd. If you want to disable root ssh access, while allowing another user ssh access, use the following: sshpw --username=example_username example_password --plaintext sshpw --username=root example_password --lock To simply disable root ssh access, use the following: sshpw --username=root example_password --lock B.2.19. text The text Kickstart command is optional.

text [--non-interactive] Options --non-interactive - Performs the installation in a completely non-interactive mode. This mode will terminate the installation when user interaction is required. Notes Note that for a fully automatic installation, you must either specify one of the available modes (graphical, text, or cmdline) in the Kickstart file, or you must use the console= boot option. If no mode is specified, the system will use graphical mode if possible, or prompt you to choose from VNC and text mode. B.2.20. url The url Kickstart command is optional. It is used to install from an installation tree image on a remote server by using the FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS protocol. You can only specify one URL. You must specify one of the --url, --metalink or --mirrorlist options. Syntax url --url=FROM [OPTIONS] Options --url=FROM - Specifies the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or file location to install from. --mirrorlist= - Specifies the mirror URL to install from. --proxy= - Specifies an HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP proxy to use during the installation. --noverifyssl - Disables SSL verification when connecting to an HTTPS server. --metalink=URL - Specifies the metalink URL to install from. Variable substitution is done for $releasever and $basearch in the URL. Examples To install from a HTTP server: url --url=http://server/path To install from a FTP server: url --url=ftp://username:password@server/path Notes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 80 Notes To actually run the installation, you must specify one of cdrom, harddrive, hmc, nfs, liveimg, ostreesetup, rhsm, or url unless the inst.repo option is specified on the kernel command line. B.2.21. vnc The vnc Kickstart command is optional. It allows the graphical installation to be viewed remotely through VNC.

Syntax authconfig [OPTIONS] Notes Previously, the auth or authconfig Kickstart commands called the authconfig tool. This tool has been deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. These Kickstart commands now use the authselect-compat tool to call the new authselect tool. For a description of the compatibility layer and its known issues, see the manual page authselect-migration(7). The installation program will automatically detect use of the deprecated commands and install on the system the authselect-compat package to provide the compatibility layer.

Syntax firewall --enabled|--disabled [incoming] [OPTIONS] Mandatory options --enabled or --enable - Reject incoming connections that are not in response to outbound requests, such as DNS replies or DHCP requests. If access to services running on this machine is needed, you can choose to allow specific services through the firewall. --disabled or --disable - Do not configure any iptables rules. Optional options --trust - Listing a device here, such as em1, allows all traffic coming to and from that device to go through the firewall. To list more than one device, use the option more times, such as --trust em1 --trust em2. Do not use a comma-separated format such as --trust em1, em2. --remove-service - Do not allow services through the firewall. incoming - Replace with one or more of the following to allow the specified services through the firewall. --ssh --smtp --http --ftp --port= - You can specify that ports be allowed through the firewall using the port:protocol format. For example, to allow IMAP access through your firewall, specify imap:tcp. Numeric ports can also be specified explicitly; for example, to allow UDP packets on port 1234 through, APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 83 specify 1234:udp. To specify multiple ports, separate them by commas. --service= - This option provides a higher-level way to allow services through the firewall. Some services (like cups, avahi, and so on.) require multiple ports to be open or other special configuration in order for the service to work. You can specify each individual port with the -- port option, or specify --service= and open them all at once. Valid options are anything recognized by the firewall-offline-cmd program in the firewalld package. If the firewalld service is running, firewall-cmd --get-services provides a list of known service names. --use-system-defaults - Do not configure the firewall at all.

lang (required) The lang Kickstart command is required. It sets the language to use during installation and the default language to use on the installed system. Syntax lang language [--addsupport=language,...] Mandatory options language - Install support for this language and set it as system default. Optional options --addsupport= - Add support for additional languages. Takes the form of comma-separated list without spaces. For example: lang en_US --addsupport=cs_CZ,de_DE,en_UK Notes The locale -a | grep _ or localectl list-locales | grep _ commands return a list of supported locales. Certain languages (for example, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Indic languages) are not supported during text-mode installation. If you specify one of these languages with the lang command, the installation process continues in English, but the installed system uses your selection as its default language. Example To set the language to English, the Kickstart file should contain the following line: lang en_US APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 85 B.3.7. module The module Kickstart command is optional. Use this command to enable a package module stream within kickstart script. Syntax module --name=NAME [--stream=STREAM] Mandatory options --name= Specifies the name of the module to enable. Replace NAME with the actual name. Optional options --stream= Specifies the name of the module stream to enable. Replace STREAM with the actual name. You do not need to specify this option for modules with a default stream defined. For modules without a default stream, this option is mandatory and leaving it out results in an error. Enabling a module multiple times with different streams is not possible. Notes Using a combination of this command and the %packages section allows you to install packages provided by the enabled module and stream combination, without specifying the module and stream explicitly. Modules must be enabled before package installation. After enabling a module with the module command, you can install the packages enabled by this module by listing them in the %packages section.

enable multiple modules, use multiple module commands. Enabling a module multiple times with different streams is not possible. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, modules are present only in the AppStream repository. To list available modules, use the dnf module list command on an installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 system with a valid subscription. Additional resources Managing Software with the DNF Tool B.3.8. repo The repo Kickstart command is optional. It configures additional dnf repositories that can be used as sources for package installation. You can add multiple repo lines. Syntax repo --name=repoid [--baseurl=url|--mirrorlist=url|--metalink=url] [OPTIONS] Mandatory options Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 86 --name= - The repository id. This option is required. If a repository has a name which conflicts with another previously added repository, it is ignored. Because the installation program uses a list of preset repositories, this means that you cannot add repositories with the same names as the preset ones. URL options These options are mutually exclusive and optional. The variables that can be used in dnf repository configuration files are not supported here. You can use the strings $releasever and $basearch which are replaced by the respective values in the URL. --baseurl= - The URL to the repository. --mirrorlist= - The URL pointing at a list of mirrors for the repository. --metalink= - The URL with metalink for the repository. Optional options --install - Save the provided repository configuration on the installed system in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. Without using this option, a repository configured in a Kickstart file will only be available during the installation process, not on the installed system. --cost= - An integer value to assign a cost to this repository. If multiple repositories provide the same packages, this number is used to prioritize which repository will be used before another. Repositories with a lower cost take priority over repositories with higher cost. --excludepkgs= - A comma-separated list of package names that must not be pulled from this repository.

sure it comes from a particular repository. Both full package names (such as publican) and globs (such as gnome-*) are accepted. --includepkgs= - A comma-separated list of package names and globs that are allowed to be pulled from this repository. Any other packages provided by the repository will be ignored. This is useful if you want to install just a single package or set of packages from a repository while excluding all other packages the repository provides. --proxy=[protocol://][username[:password]@]host[:port] - Specify an HTTP/HTTPS/FTP proxy to use just for this repository. This setting does not affect any other repositories, nor how the install.img is fetched on HTTP installations. --noverifyssl - Disable SSL verification when connecting to an HTTPS server. Notes Repositories used for installation must be stable. The installation can fail if a repository is modified before the installation concludes. B.3.9. rootpw (required) The rootpw Kickstart command is required. It sets the system’s root password to the password argument. Syntax rootpw [--iscrypted|--plaintext] [--lock] password APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 87 Mandatory options password - Password specification. Either plain text or encrypted string. See --iscrypted and -- plaintext below. Options --iscrypted - If this option is present, the password argument is assumed to already be encrypted. This option is mutually exclusive with --plaintext. To create an encrypted password, you can use python: $ python -c 'import crypt,getpass;pw=getpass.getpass();print(crypt.crypt(pw) if (pw==getpass.getpass(\"Confirm: \")) else exit())' This generates a sha512 crypt-compatible hash of your password using a random salt. --plaintext - If this option is present, the password argument is assumed to be in plain text. This option is mutually exclusive with --iscrypted. --lock - If this option is present, the root account is locked by default.

It must be wrapped with quotes. B.3.14. syspurpose The syspurpose Kickstart command is optional. Use it to set the system purpose which describes how the system will be used after installation. This information helps apply the correct subscription entitlement to the system. NOTE Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 and later enables you to manage and display system purpose attributes with a single module by making the role, service-level, usage, and addons subcommands available under one subscription-manager syspurpose module. Previously, system administrators used one of four standalone syspurpose commands to manage each attribute. This standalone syspurpose command is deprecated starting with RHEL 9.0 and is planned to be removed in post RHEL 9. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this feature during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements. Starting with RHEL 9, the single subscription- manager syspurpose command and its associated subcommands is the only way to use system purpose. Syntax syspurpose [OPTIONS] Options --role= - Set the intended system role. Available values are: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation Red Hat Enterprise Linux Compute Node --sla= - Set the Service Level Agreement.

Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 90 Development/Test --addon= - Specifies additional layered products or features. You can use this option multiple times. Notes Enter the values with spaces and enclose them in double quotes: syspurpose --role=\"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server\" While it is strongly recommended that you configure System Purpose, it is an optional feature of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program. B.3.15. timezone (required) The timezone Kickstart command is required. It sets the system time zone. Syntax timezone timezone [OPTIONS] Mandatory options timezone - the time zone to set for the system. Optional options --utc - If present, the system assumes the hardware clock is set to UTC (Greenwich Mean) time. --nontp - Disable the NTP service automatic starting. This option is deprecated. --ntpservers= - Specify a list of NTP servers to be used as a comma-separated list without spaces. This option is deprecated, use the timesource command instead. Notes In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, time zone names are validated using the pytz.all_timezones list, provided by the pytz package. In previous releases, the names were validated against pytz.common_timezones, which is a subset of the currently used list. Note that the graphical and text mode interfaces still use the more restricted pytz.common_timezones list; you must use a Kickstart file to use additional time zone definitions. B.3.16. timesource (optional) The timesource kickstart command is optional. Use it to set NTP, NTS servers, and pools that provide time data, as well as control whether NTP services are enabled or disabled on the system. Syntax timesource [--ntp-server NTP_SERVER | --ntp-pool NTP_POOL | --ntp-disable] [--nts] Mandatory options APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 91 It is mandatory to specify one of the following options when you use the timesource command: --ntp-server - adds one NTP server as a time source.

add multiple sources, add multiple timesource commands each with a single --ntp-server or --ntp-pool option each time. For example, to add multiple sources for Europe timezone timezone Europe timesource --ntp-server 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org timesource --ntp-server 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org timesource --ntp-server 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org --ntp-pool - adds a NTP server pool as a time source. This option can be added only once to add a single NTP time source pool. Repeat the timesource command to add multiple sources. --ntp-disable - disables NTP time sources for the installed system. Optional options --nts - the server or pool added with this command uses the NTS protocol. Note that this option can be added even with --ntp-disable, but it has no effect. Notes The --ntpservers option from the timezone command is deprecated. Red Hat recommends using this new option for expressive capabilities of the timesource command. Only timesource command can mark servers and pools as using NTS instead of plain NTP protocol. B.3.17. user The user Kickstart command is optional. It creates a new user on the system. Syntax user --name=username [OPTIONS] Mandatory options --name= - Provides the name of the user. This option is required. Optional options --gecos= - Provides the GECOS information for the user. This is a string of various system- specific fields separated by a comma. It is frequently used to specify the user’s full name, office number, and so on. See the passwd(5) man page for more details. --groups= - In addition to the default group, a comma separated list of group names the user should belong to. The groups must exist before the user account is created. See the group command. --homedir= - The home directory for the user. If not provided, this defaults to /home/username. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 92 --lock - If this option is present, this account is locked by default.

option will also disable the Create User screens in both the graphical and text-based manual installation. --password= - The new user’s password. If not provided, the account will be locked by default. --iscrypted - If this option is present, the password argument is assumed to already be encrypted. This option is mutually exclusive with --plaintext. To create an encrypted password, you can use python: $ python -c 'import crypt,getpass;pw=getpass.getpass();print(crypt.crypt(pw) if (pw==getpass.getpass(\"Confirm: \")) else exit())' This generates a sha512 crypt-compatible hash of your password using a random salt. --plaintext - If this option is present, the password argument is assumed to be in plain text. This option is mutually exclusive with --iscrypted --shell= - The user’s login shell. If not provided, the system default is used. --uid= - The user’s UID (User ID). If not provided, this defaults to the next available non-system UID. --gid= - The GID (Group ID) to be used for the user’s group. If not provided, this defaults to the next available non-system group ID. Notes Consider using the --uid and --gid options to set IDs of regular users and their default groups at range starting at 5000 instead of 1000. That is because the range reserved for system users and groups, 0-999, might increase in the future and thus overlap with IDs of regular users. Files and directories are created with various permissions, dictated by the application used to create the file or directory. For example, the mkdir command creates directories with all permissions enabled. However, applications are prevented from granting certain permissions to newly created files, as specified by the user file-creation mask setting. The user file-creation mask can be controlled with the umask command. The default setting of the user file-creation mask for new users is defined by the UMASK variable in the /etc/login.defs configuration file on the installed system. If unset, it defaults to 022. This means that by default when an application creates a file, it is prevented from granting write permission to users other than the owner of the file.

this can be overridden by other settings or scripts. B.3.18. xconfig The xconfig Kickstart command is optional. It configures the X Window System. Syntax xconfig [--startxonboot] Options --startxonboot - Use a graphical login on the installed system. APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 93 Notes Because Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 does not include the KDE Desktop Environment, do not use the --defaultdesktop= documented in upstream. B.4. KICKSTART COMMANDS FOR NETWORK CONFIGURATION The Kickstart commands in this list let you configure networking on the system. B.4.1. network (optional) Use the optional network Kickstart command to configure network information for the target system and activate the network devices in the installation environment. The device specified in the first network command is activated automatically. You can also explicitly require a device to be activated using the --activate option. Syntax network OPTIONS Options --activate - activate this device in the installation environment. If you use the --activate option on a device that has already been activated (for example, an interface you configured with boot options so that the system could retrieve the Kickstart file) the device is reactivated to use the details specified in the Kickstart file. Use the --nodefroute option to prevent the device from using the default route. --no-activate - do not activate this device in the installation environment. By default, Anaconda activates the first network device in the Kickstart file regardless of the -- activate option. You can disable the default setting by using the --no-activate option. --bootproto= - One of dhcp, bootp, ibft, or static. The default option is dhcp; the dhcp and bootp options are treated the same. To disable ipv4 configuration of the device, use --noipv4 option. NOTE This option configures ipv4 configuration of the device. For ipv6 configuration use --ipv6 and --ipv6gateway options.

direct a system to use DHCP: network --bootproto=dhcp To direct a machine to use BOOTP to obtain its networking configuration, use the following line in the Kickstart file: network --bootproto=bootp Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 94 To direct a machine to use the configuration specified in iBFT, use: network --bootproto=ibft The static method requires that you specify at least the IP address and netmask in the Kickstart file. This information is static and is used during and after the installation. All static networking configuration information must be specified on one line; you cannot wrap lines using a backslash (\\) as you can on a command line. network --bootproto=static --ip=10.0.2.15 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=10.0.2.254 -- nameserver=10.0.2.1 You can also configure multiple nameservers at the same time. To do so, use the -- nameserver= option once, and specify each of their IP addresses, separated by commas: network --bootproto=static --ip=10.0.2.15 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=10.0.2.254 -- nameserver=192.168.2.1,192.168.3.1 --device= - specifies the device to be configured (and eventually activated in Anaconda) with the network command. If the --device= option is missing on the first use of the network command, the value of the inst.ks.device= Anaconda boot option is used, if available. Note that this is considered deprecated behavior; in most cases, you should always specify a --device= for every network command. IMPORTANT Network teaming is deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. Consider using the network bonding driver as an alternative. For details, see Configuring network bonding.

keyword bootif, which uses the MAC address that pxelinux set in the BOOTIF variable. Set IPAPPEND 2 in your pxelinux.cfg file to have pxelinux set the BOOTIF variable. For example: network --bootproto=dhcp --device=em1 --ip= - IP address of the device. --ipv6= - IPv6 address of the device, in the form of address[/prefix length] - for example, APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 95 --ipv6= - IPv6 address of the device, in the form of address[/prefix length] - for example, 3ffe:ffff:0:1::1/128. If prefix is omitted, 64 is used. You can also use auto for automatic configuration, or dhcp for DHCPv6-only configuration (no router advertisements). --gateway= - Default gateway as a single IPv4 address. --ipv6gateway= - Default gateway as a single IPv6 address. --nodefroute - Prevents the interface being set as the default route. Use this option when you activate additional devices with the --activate= option, for example, a NIC on a separate subnet for an iSCSI target. --nameserver= - DNS name server, as an IP address. To specify more than one name server, use this option once, and separate each IP address with a comma. --netmask= - Network mask for the installed system. --hostname= - Used to configure the target system’s host name. The host name can either be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the format hostname.domainname, or a short host name without the domain. Many networks have a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) service that automatically supplies connected systems with a domain name. To allow the DHCP service to assign the domain name to this machine, specify only the short host name.

to use a short name or FQDN. Red Hat Identity Management configures FQDN during provisioning but some 3rd party software products may require short name. In either case, to ensure availability of both forms in all situations, add an entry for the host in /etc/hosts in the format IP FQDN short-alias. Host names can only contain alphanumeric characters and - or .. Host name should be equal to or less than 64 characters. Host names cannot start or end with - and .. To be compliant with DNS, each part of a FQDN should be equal to or less than 63 characters and the FQDN total length, including dots, should not exceed 255 characters. If you only want to configure the target system’s host name, use the --hostname option in the network command and do not include any other option. If you provide additional options when configuring the host name, the network command configures a device using the options specified. If you do not specify which device to configure using the --device option, the default --device link value is used. Additionally, if you do not specify the protocol using the --bootproto option, the device is configured to use DHCP by default. --ethtool= - Specifies additional low-level settings for the network device which will be passed to the ethtool program. --onboot= - Whether or not to enable the device at boot time. --dhcpclass= - The DHCP class. --mtu= - The MTU of the device. --noipv4 - Disable IPv4 on this device. --noipv6 - Disable IPv6 on this device. --bondslaves= - When this option is used, the bond device specified by the --device= option is created using secondary devices defined in the --bondslaves= option.

and --device= options. Options in this list must be separated by commas (“,”) or semicolons (“;”). If an option itself contains a comma, use a semicolon to separate the options. For example: network --bondopts=mode=active-backup,balance-rr;primary=eth1 IMPORTANT The --bondopts=mode= parameter only supports full mode names such as balance-rr or broadcast, not their numerical representations such as 0 or 3. For the list of available and supported modes, see Configuring and Managing Networking Guide. --vlanid= - Specifies virtual LAN (VLAN) ID number (802.1q tag) for the device created using the device specified in --device= as a parent. For example, network --device=em1 -- vlanid=171 creates a virtual LAN device em1.171. --interfacename= - Specify a custom interface name for a virtual LAN device. This option should be used when the default name generated by the --vlanid= option is not desirable. This option must be used along with --vlanid=. For example: network --device=em1 --vlanid=171 --interfacename=vlan171 The above command creates a virtual LAN interface named vlan171 on the em1 device with an ID of 171. The interface name can be arbitrary (for example, my-vlan), but in specific cases, the following conventions must be followed: If the name contains a dot (.), it must take the form of NAME.ID. The NAME is arbitrary, but the ID must be the VLAN ID. For example: em1.171 or my-vlan.171. Names starting with vlan must take the form of vlanID - for example, vlan171. --teamslaves= - Team device specified by the --device= option will be created using secondary devices specified in this option. Secondary devices are separated by commas. A secondary device can be followed by its configuration, which is a single-quoted JSON string with double quotes escaped by the \\ character.

Consider using the network bonding driver as an alternative. For details, see Configuring network bonding. --bridgeslaves= - When this option is used, the network bridge with device name specified using the --device= option will be created and devices defined in the --bridgeslaves= option will be added to the bridge. For example: network --device=bridge0 --bridgeslaves=em1 --bridgeopts= - An optional comma-separated list of parameters for the bridged interface. Available values are stp, priority, forward-delay, hello-time, max-age, and ageing-time. For information about these parameters, see the bridge setting table in the nm-settings(5) man page or at Network Configuration Setting Specification.

Note that this option is independent of the --device= option - --bindto=mac will be applied even if the same network command also specifies a device name, link, or bootif. Notes The ethN device names such as eth0 are no longer available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux due to changes in the naming scheme. For more information about the device naming scheme, see the upstream document Predictable Network Interface Names. If you used a Kickstart option or a boot option to specify an installation repository on a network, but no network is available at the start of the installation, the installation program displays the Network Configuration window to set up a network connection prior to displaying the Installation Summary window. For more details, see the Configuring network and host name options section of the Performing a standard RHEL 9 installation document. B.4.2. realm The realm Kickstart command is optional. Use it to join an Active Directory or IPA domain. For more information about this command, see the join section of the realm(8) man page.

KICKSTART COMMANDS FOR HANDLING STORAGE The Kickstart commands in this section configure aspects of storage such as devices, disks, partitions, LVM, and filesystems. IMPORTANT The sdX (or /dev/sdX) format does not guarantee consistent device names across reboots, which can complicate the usage of some Kickstart commands. When a command requires a device node name, you can use any item from /dev/disk as an alternative. For example, instead of using the following device name: part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=sda1 You can use an entry similar to one of the following: part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:05.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1 part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160815AS_6RA0C882-part1 By using this approach, the command always targets the same storage device. This is especially useful in large storage environments. To explore the available device names on the system, you can use the ls -lR /dev/disk command during the interactive installation. For more information about different ways to consistently refer to storage devices, see Overview of persistent naming attributes. B.5.1. autopart The autopart Kickstart command is optional. It automatically creates partitions. APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 99 The automatically created partitions are: a root (/) partition (1 GiB or larger), a swap partition, and an appropriate /boot partition for the architecture. On large enough drives (50 GiB and larger), this also creates a /home partition. Syntax autopart OPTIONS Options --type= - Selects one of the predefined automatic partitioning schemes you want to use.

available values are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, and vfat. The default file system is xfs. --nohome - Disables automatic creation of the /home partition. --nolvm - Do not use LVM for automatic partitioning. This option is equal to --type=plain. --noboot - Do not create a /boot partition. --noswap - Do not create a swap partition. --encrypted - Encrypts all partitions with Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS). This is equivalent to checking the Encrypt partitions check box on the initial partitioning screen during a manual graphical installation. NOTE When encrypting one or more partitions, Anaconda attempts to gather 256 bits of entropy to ensure the partitions are encrypted securely. Gathering entropy can take some time - the process will stop after a maximum of 10 minutes, regardless of whether sufficient entropy has been gathered. The process can be sped up by interacting with the installation system (typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse). If you are installing in a virtual machine, you can also attach a virtio-rng device (a virtual random number generator) to the guest. --luks-version=LUKS_VERSION - Specifies which version of LUKS format should be used to encrypt the filesystem. This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --passphrase= - Provides a default system-wide passphrase for all encrypted devices. --escrowcert=URL_of_X.509_certificate - Stores data encryption keys of all encrypted volumes as files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate from the URL specified with URL_of_X.509_certificate. The keys are stored as a separate file for each encrypted volume. This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 100 --backuppassphrase - Adds a randomly-generated passphrase to each encrypted volume. Store these passphrases in separate files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate specified with --escrowcert.

satisfactory. You must use this option together with the --encrypted option; by itself it has no effect. Available types of encryption are listed in the Security hardening document, but Red Hat strongly recommends using either aes-xts-plain64 or aes-cbc-essiv:sha256. --pbkdf=PBKDF - Sets Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) algorithm for LUKS keyslot. See also the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --pbkdf-memory=PBKDF_MEMORY - Sets the memory cost for PBKDF. See also the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --pbkdf-time=PBKDF_TIME - Sets the number of milliseconds to spend with PBKDF passphrase processing. See also --iter-time in the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified, and is mutually exclusive with --pbkdf-iterations. --pbkdf-iterations=PBKDF_ITERATIONS - Sets the number of iterations directly and avoids PBKDF benchmark. See also --pbkdf-force-iterations in the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified, and is mutually exclusive with --pbkdf- time. Notes The autopart option cannot be used together with the part/partition, raid, logvol, or volgroup options in the same Kickstart file. The autopart command is not mandatory, but you must include it if there are no part or mount commands in your Kickstart script. It is recommended to use the autopart --nohome Kickstart option when installing on a single FBA DASD of the CMS type. This ensures that the installation program does not create a separate /home partition. The installation then proceeds successfully. If you lose the LUKS passphrase, any encrypted partitions and their data is completely inaccessible. There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.

options. Ensure that the disk sector sizes are consistent when using autopart, autopart --type=lvm, or autopart=thinp. B.5.2. bootloader (required) The bootloader Kickstart command is required. It specifies how the boot loader should be installed. Syntax bootloader [OPTIONS] Options --append= - Specifies additional kernel parameters. To specify multiple parameters, separate APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 101 --append= - Specifies additional kernel parameters. To specify multiple parameters, separate them with spaces. For example: bootloader --location=mbr --append=\"hdd=ide-scsi ide=nodma\" The rhgb and quiet parameters are automatically added when the plymouth package is installed, even if you do not specify them here or do not use the --append= command at all. To disable this behavior, explicitly disallow installation of plymouth: %packages -plymouth %end This option is useful for disabling mechanisms which were implemented to mitigate the Meltdown and Spectre speculative execution vulnerabilities found in most modern processors (CVE-2017-5754, CVE-2017-5753, and CVE-2017-5715). In some cases, these mechanisms may be unnecessary, and keeping them enabled causes decreased performance with no improvement in security. To disable these mechanisms, add the options to do so into your Kickstart file - for example, bootloader --append=\"nopti noibrs noibpb\" on AMD64/Intel 64 systems. WARNING Ensure your system is not at risk of attack before disabling any of the vulnerability mitigation mechanisms. See the Red Hat vulnerability response article for information about the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. --boot-drive= - Specifies which drive the boot loader should be written to, and therefore which drive the computer will boot from. If you use a multipath device as the boot drive, specify the device using its disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-WWID name.

zipl is installed, it determines the boot drive on its own. --leavebootorder - The installation program adds Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 to the list of the installed systems in UEFI. It does not add the installed system to the boot order. All existing boot entries as well as their order are preserved. IMPORTANT This option is applicable for Power and UEFI systems. --driveorder= - Specifies which drive is first in the BIOS boot order. For example: bootloader --driveorder=sda,hda  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 102 --location= - Specifies where the boot record is written. Valid values are the following: mbr - The default option. Depends on whether the drive uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme: On a GPT-formatted disk, this option installs stage 1.5 of the boot loader into the BIOS boot partition. On an MBR-formatted disk, stage 1.5 is installed into the empty space between the MBR and the first partition. partition - Install the boot loader on the first sector of the partition containing the kernel. none - Do not install the boot loader. In most cases, this option does not need to be specified. --nombr - Do not install the boot loader to the MBR. --password= - If using GRUB2, sets the boot loader password to the one specified with this option. This should be used to restrict access to the GRUB2 shell, where arbitrary kernel options can be passed. If a password is specified, GRUB2 also asks for a user name. The user name is always root. --iscrypted - Normally, when you specify a boot loader password using the --password= option, it is stored in the Kickstart file in plain text. If you want to encrypt the password, use this option and an encrypted password. To generate an encrypted password, use the grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command, enter the password you want to use, and copy the command’s output (the hash starting with grub.pbkdf2) into the Kickstart file.

--default= - Sets the default boot image in the boot loader configuration. --extlinux - Use the extlinux boot loader instead of GRUB2. This option only works on systems supported by extlinux. --disabled - This option is a stronger version of --location=none. While --location=none simply disables boot loader installation, --disabled disables boot loader installation and also disables installation of the package containing the boot loader, thus saving space. Notes Red Hat recommends setting up a boot loader password on every system. An unprotected boot loader can allow a potential attacker to modify the system’s boot options and gain unauthorized access to the system. APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 103 In some cases, a special partition is required to install the boot loader on AMD64, Intel 64, and 64-bit ARM systems. The type and size of this partition depends on whether the disk you are installing the boot loader to uses the Master Boot Record (MBR) or a GUID Partition Table (GPT) schema. For more information, see the Configuring boot loader section of the Performing a standard RHEL 9 installation document.

can complicate the usage of some Kickstart commands. When a command requires a device node name, you can use any item from /dev/disk as an alternative. For example, instead of using the following device name: part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=sda1 You can use an entry similar to one of the following: part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:05.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1 part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160815AS_6RA0C882-part1 By using this approach, the command always targets the same storage device. This is especially useful in large storage environments. To explore the available device names on the system, you can use the ls -lR /dev/disk command during the interactive installation. For more information about different ways to consistently refer to storage devices, see Overview of persistent naming attributes. B.5.3. zipl The zipl Kickstart command is optional. It specifies the ZIPL configuration for 64-bit IBM Z. Options --secure-boot - Enables secure boot if it is supported by the installing system. NOTE When installed on a system that is later than IBM z14, the installed system cannot be booted from an IBM z14 or earlier model. --force-secure-boot - Enables secure boot unconditionally. NOTE Installation is not supported on IBM z14 and earlier models. --no-secure-boot - Disables secure boot. NOTE Secure Boot is not supported on IBM z14 and earlier models. Use --no-secure-boot if you intend to boot the installed system on IBM z14 and earlier models. B.5.4. clearpart Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 104 The clearpart Kickstart command is optional. It removes partitions from the system, prior to creation of new partitions. By default, no partitions are removed. Syntax clearpart OPTIONS Options --all - Erases all partitions from the system.

network storage. Use this option with caution. You can prevent clearpart from wiping storage you want to preserve by using the --drives= option and specifying only the drives you want to clear, by attaching network storage later (for example, in the %post section of the Kickstart file), or by blocklisting the kernel modules used to access network storage. --drives= - Specifies which drives to clear partitions from. For example, the following clears all the partitions on the first two drives on the primary IDE controller: clearpart --drives=hda,hdb --all To clear a multipath device, use the format disk/by-id/scsi-WWID, where WWID is the world- wide identifier for the device. For example, to clear a disk with WWID 58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918, use: clearpart --drives=disk/by-id/scsi-58095BEC5510947BE8C0360F604351918 This format is preferable for all multipath devices, but if errors arise, multipath devices that do not use logical volume management (LVM) can also be cleared using the format disk/by-id/dm- uuid-mpath-WWID, where WWID is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to clear a disk with WWID 2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017, use: clearpart --drives=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017 Never specify multipath devices by device names like mpatha. Device names such as this are not specific to a particular disk. The disk named /dev/mpatha during installation might not be the one that you expect it to be. Therefore, the clearpart command could target the wrong disk. --initlabel - Initializes a disk (or disks) by creating a default disk label for all disks in their respective architecture that have been designated for formatting (for example, msdos for x86). Because --initlabel can see all disks, it is important to ensure only those drives that are to be formatted are connected.

is not used. clearpart --initlabel --drives=names_of_disks For example: clearpart --initlabel --drives=dasda,dasdb,dasdc --list= - Specifies which partitions to clear. This option overrides the --all and --linux options if APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 105 --list= - Specifies which partitions to clear. This option overrides the --all and --linux options if used. Can be used across different drives. For example: clearpart --list=sda2,sda3,sdb1 --disklabel=LABEL - Set the default disklabel to use. Only disklabels supported for the platform will be accepted. For example, on the 64-bit Intel and AMD architectures, the msdos and gpt disklabels are accepted, but dasd is not accepted. --linux - Erases all Linux partitions. --none (default) - Do not remove any partitions. --cdl - Reformat any LDL DASDs to CDL format. Notes The sdX (or /dev/sdX) format does not guarantee consistent device names across reboots, which can complicate the usage of some Kickstart commands. When a command requires a device node name, you can use any item from /dev/disk as an alternative. For example, instead of using the following device name: part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=sda1 You can use an entry similar to one of the following: part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:05.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1 part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160815AS_6RA0C882-part1 By using this approach, the command always targets the same storage device. This is especially useful in large storage environments. To explore the available device names on the system, you can use the ls -lR /dev/disk command during the interactive installation.

different ways to consistently refer to storage devices, see Overview of persistent naming attributes. If the clearpart command is used, then the part --onpart command cannot be used on a logical partition. B.5.5. fcoe The fcoe Kickstart command is optional. It specifies which FCoE devices should be activated automatically in addition to those discovered by Enhanced Disk Drive Services (EDD). Syntax fcoe --nic=name [OPTIONS] Options --nic= (required) - The name of the device to be activated. --dcb= - Establish Data Center Bridging (DCB) settings. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 106 --autovlan - Discover VLANs automatically. This option is enabled by default. B.5.6. ignoredisk The ignoredisk Kickstart command is optional. It causes the installation program to ignore the specified disks. This is useful if you use automatic partitioning and want to be sure that some disks are ignored. For example, without ignoredisk, attempting to deploy on a SAN-cluster the Kickstart would fail, as the installation program detects passive paths to the SAN that return no partition table. Syntax ignoredisk --drives=drive1,drive2,... | --only-use=drive Options --drives=driveN,...​ - Replace driveN with one of sda, sdb,...​, hda,...​ and so on. --only-use=driveN,...​ - Specifies a list of disks for the installation program to use. All other disks are ignored. For example, to use disk sda during installation and ignore all other disks: ignoredisk --only-use=sda To include a multipath device that does not use LVM: ignoredisk --only-use=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017 To include a multipath device that uses LVM: ignoredisk --only-use==/dev/disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath- bootloader --location=mbr You must specify only one of the --drives or --only-use.

ignore a multipath device that does not use logical volume management (LVM), use the format disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-WWID, where WWID is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to ignore a disk with WWID 2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017, use: ignoredisk --drives=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017 Never specify multipath devices by device names like mpatha. Device names such as this are not specific to a particular disk. The disk named /dev/mpatha during installation might not be the one that you expect it to be. Therefore, the clearpart command could target the wrong disk. The sdX (or /dev/sdX) format does not guarantee consistent device names across reboots, which can complicate the usage of some Kickstart commands. When a command requires a device node name, you can use any item from /dev/disk as an alternative. For example, instead of using the following device name: APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 107 part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=sda1 You can use an entry similar to one of the following: part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:05.0-scsi-0:0:0:0-part1 part / --fstype=xfs --onpart=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST3160815AS_6RA0C882-part1 By using this approach, the command always targets the same storage device. This is especially useful in large storage environments. To explore the available device names on the system, you can use the ls -lR /dev/disk command during the interactive installation. For more information about different ways to consistently refer to storage devices, see Overview of persistent naming attributes. B.5.7. iscsi The iscsi Kickstart command is optional.

file. B.5.9. logvol The logvol Kickstart command is optional. It creates a logical volume for Logical Volume Management (LVM). Syntax logvol mntpoint --vgname=name --name=name [OPTIONS] Mandatory options mntpoint The mount point where the partition is mounted. Must be of one of the following forms: /path For example, / or /home swap The partition is used as swap space. To determine the size of the swap partition automatically, use the --recommended option: swap --recommended To determine the size of the swap partition automatically and also allow extra space for your system to hibernate, use the --hibernation option: APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 109 swap --hibernation The size assigned will be equivalent to the swap space assigned by --recommended plus the amount of RAM on your system. --vgname=name Name of the volume group. --name=name Name of the logical volume. Optional options --noformat Use an existing logical volume and do not format it. --useexisting Use an existing logical volume and reformat it. --fstype= Sets the file system type for the logical volume. Valid values are xfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, swap, and vfat. --fsoptions= Specifies a free form string of options to be used when mounting the filesystem. This string will be copied into the /etc/fstab file of the installed system and should be enclosed in quotes. NOTE In the EFI system partition (/boot/efi), anaconda hard codes the value and ignores the users specified --fsoptions values. --mkfsoptions= Specifies additional parameters to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition. No processing is done on the list of arguments, so they must be supplied in a format that can be passed directly to the mkfs program. This means multiple options should be comma- separated or surrounded by double quotes, depending on the filesystem. --fsprofile= Specifies a usage type to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition.

type defines a variety of tuning parameters to be used when making a filesystem. For this option to work, the filesystem must support the concept of usage types and there must be a configuration file that lists valid types. For ext2, ext3, and ext4, this configuration file is /etc/mke2fs.conf. --label= Sets a label for the logical volume. --grow Extends the logical volume to occupy the available space (if any), or up to the maximum size specified, if any. The option must be used only if you have pre-allocated a minimum storage space in the disk image, and would want the volume to grow and occupy the available space. In a physical environment, this is an one-time-action. However, in a virtual environment, the volume size increases as and when the virtual machine writes any data to the virtual disk. --size= The size of the logical volume in MiB. This option cannot be used together with the --percent= Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 110 The size of the logical volume in MiB. This option cannot be used together with the --percent= option. --percent= The size of the logical volume, as a percentage of the free space in the volume group after any statically-sized logical volumes are taken into account. This option cannot be used together with the --size= option. IMPORTANT When creating a new logical volume, you must either specify its size statically using the --size= option, or as a percentage of remaining free space using the --percent= option. You cannot use both of these options on the same logical volume. --maxsize= The maximum size in MiB when the logical volume is set to grow. Specify an integer value here such as 500 (do not include the unit). --recommended Use this option when creating a logical volume to determine the size of this volume automatically, based on your system’s hardware. --resize Resize a logical volume.

you do not specify a passphrase, the installation program uses the default, system-wide passphrase set with the autopart --passphrase command, or stops the installation and prompts you to provide a passphrase if no default is set. NOTE When encrypting one or more partitions, Anaconda attempts to gather 256 bits of entropy to ensure the partitions are encrypted securely. Gathering entropy can take some time - the process will stop after a maximum of 10 minutes, regardless of whether sufficient entropy has been gathered. The process can be sped up by interacting with the installation system (typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse). If you are installing in a virtual machine, you can also attach a virtio-rng device (a virtual random number generator) to the guest. --passphrase= Specifies the passphrase to use when encrypting this logical volume. You must use this option together with the --encrypted option; it has no effect by itself. --cipher= Specifies the type of encryption to use if the Anaconda default aes-xts-plain64 is not satisfactory. You must use this option together with the --encrypted option; by itself it has no effect. Available types of encryption are listed in the Security hardening document, but Red Hat strongly recommends using either aes-xts-plain64 or aes-cbc-essiv:sha256. --escrowcert=URL_of_X.509_certificate Store data encryption keys of all encrypted volumes as files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 111 Store data encryption keys of all encrypted volumes as files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate from the URL specified with URL_of_X.509_certificate. The keys are stored as a separate file for each encrypted volume. This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --luks-version=LUKS_VERSION Specifies which version of LUKS format should be used to encrypt the filesystem. This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --backuppassphrase Add a randomly-generated passphrase to each encrypted volume.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 112 NOTE For more information about cached logical volumes and their modes, see the lvmcache(7) man page. --cachesize= Size of cache attached to the logical volume, specified in MiB. This option requires the --cachepvs= option. Notes Do not use the dash (-) character in logical volume and volume group names when installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux using Kickstart. If this character is used, the installation finishes normally, but the /dev/mapper/ directory will list these volumes and volume groups with every dash doubled. For example, a volume group named volgrp-01 containing a logical volume named logvol-01 will be listed as /dev/mapper/volgrp—​01-logvol—​01. This limitation only applies to newly created logical volume and volume group names. If you are reusing existing ones using the --noformat option, their names will not be changed. If you lose the LUKS passphrase, any encrypted partitions and their data is completely inaccessible. There is no way to recover a lost passphrase. However, you can save encryption passphrases with the --escrowcert and create backup encryption passphrases with the -- backuppassphrase options. Examples Create the partition first, create the logical volume group, and then create the logical volume: part pv.01 --size 3000 volgroup myvg pv.01 logvol / --vgname=myvg --size=2000 --name=rootvol Create the partition first, create the logical volume group, and then create the logical volume to occupy 90% of the remaining space in the volume group: part pv.01 --size 1 --grow volgroup myvg pv.01 logvol / --vgname=myvg --name=rootvol --percent=90 Additional resources Configuring and managing logical volumes B.5.10. mount The mount Kickstart command is optional.

Mandatory options: device - The block device to mount. mountpoint - Where to mount the device. It must be a valid mount point, such as / or /usr, or none if the device is unmountable (for example swap). Optional options: --reformat= - Specifies a new format (such as ext4) to which the device should be reformatted. --mkfsoptions= - Specifies additional options to be passed to the command which creates the new file system specified in --reformat=. The list of options provided here is not processed, so they must be specified in a format that can be passed directly to the mkfs program. The list of options should be either comma-separated or surrounded by double quotes, depending on the file system. See the mkfs man page for the file system you want to create (for example mkfs.ext4(8) or mkfs.xfs(8)) for specific details. --mountoptions= - Specifies a free form string that contains options to be used when mounting the file system. The string will be copied to the /etc/fstab file on the installed system and should be enclosed in double quotes. See the mount(8) man page for a full list of mount options, and fstab(5) for basics. Notes Unlike most other storage configuration commands in Kickstart, mount does not require you to describe the entire storage configuration in the Kickstart file. You only need to ensure that the described block device exists on the system. However, if you want to create the storage stack with all the devices mounted, you must use other commands such as part to do so. You can not use mount together with other storage-related commands such as part, logvol, or autopart in the same Kickstart file. B.5.11. nvdimm The nvdimm Kickstart command is optional. It performs an action on Non-Volatile Dual In-line Memory Module (NVDIMM) devices. Syntax nvdimm action [OPTIONS] Actions reconfigure - Reconfigure a specific NVDIMM device into a given mode.

--recommended The size assigned will be effective but not precisely calibrated for your system. To determine the size of the swap partition automatically but also allow extra space for your APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 115 To determine the size of the swap partition automatically but also allow extra space for your system to hibernate, use the --hibernation option: swap --hibernation The size assigned will be equivalent to the swap space assigned by --recommended plus the amount of RAM on your system. raid.id The partition is used for software RAID (see raid). pv.id The partition is used for LVM (see logvol). biosboot The partition will be used for a BIOS Boot partition. A 1 MiB BIOS boot partition is necessary on BIOS-based AMD64 and Intel 64 systems using a GUID Partition Table (GPT); the boot loader will be installed into it. It is not necessary on UEFI systems. See also the bootloader command. /boot/efi An EFI System Partition. A 50 MiB EFI partition is necessary on UEFI-based AMD64, Intel 64, and 64-bit ARM; the recommended size is 200 MiB. It is not necessary on BIOS systems. See also the bootloader command. --size= - The minimum partition size in MiB. Specify an integer value here such as 500 (do not include the unit). IMPORTANT If the --size value is too small, the installation fails. Set the --size value as the minimum amount of space you require. --grow - Tells the partition to grow to fill available space (if any), or up to the maximum size setting, if one is specified. NOTE If you use --grow= without setting --maxsize= on a swap partition, Anaconda limits the maximum size of the swap partition. For systems that have less than 2 GiB of physical memory, the imposed limit is twice the amount of physical memory. For systems with more than 2 GiB, the imposed limit is the size of physical memory plus 2GiB. --maxsize= - The maximum partition size in MiB when the partition is set to grow.

an integer value here such as 500 (do not include the unit). --noformat - Specifies that the partition should not be formatted, for use with the --onpart command. --onpart= or --usepart= - Specifies the device on which to place the partition. Uses an existing blank device and format it to the new specified type. For example: partition /home --onpart=hda1 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 116 puts /home on /dev/hda1. These options can also add a partition to a logical volume. For example: partition pv.1 --onpart=hda2 The device must already exist on the system; the --onpart option will not create it. It is also possible to specify an entire drive, rather than a partition, in which case Anaconda will format and use the drive without creating a partition table. Note, however, that installation of GRUB2 is not supported on a device formatted in this way, and must be placed on a drive with a partition table. partition pv.1 --onpart=hdb --ondisk= or --ondrive= - Creates a partition (specified by the part command) on an existing disk.This command always creates a partition. Forces the partition to be created on a particular disk. For example, --ondisk=sdb puts the partition on the second SCSI disk on the system. To specify a multipath device that does not use logical volume management (LVM), use the format disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-WWID, where WWID is the world-wide identifier for the device. For example, to specify a disk with WWID 2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017, use: part / --fstype=xfs --grow --asprimary --size=8192 --ondisk=disk/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath- 2416CD96995134CA5D787F00A5AA11017 WARNING Never specify multipath devices by device names like mpatha.

during installation might not be the one that you expect it to be. Therefore, the part command could target the wrong disk. --asprimary - Forces the partition to be allocated as a primary partition. If the partition cannot be allocated as primary (usually due to too many primary partitions being already allocated), the partitioning process fails. This option only makes sense when the disk uses a Master Boot Record (MBR); for GUID Partition Table (GPT)-labeled disks this option has no meaning. --fsprofile= - Specifies a usage type to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition. A usage type defines a variety of tuning parameters to be used when making a filesystem. For this option to work, the filesystem must support the concept of usage types and there must be a configuration file that lists valid types. For ext2, ext3, ext4, this configuration file is /etc/mke2fs.conf. --mkfsoptions= - Specifies additional parameters to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition. This is similar to --fsprofile but works for all filesystems, not just the ones that support the profile concept. No processing is done on the list of arguments, so they  APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 117 must be supplied in a format that can be passed directly to the mkfs program. This means multiple options should be comma-separated or surrounded by double quotes, depending on the filesystem. --fstype= - Sets the file system type for the partition. Valid values are xfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, swap, vfat, efi and biosboot. --fsoptions - Specifies a free form string of options to be used when mounting the filesystem. This string will be copied into the /etc/fstab file of the installed system and should be enclosed in quotes. NOTE In the EFI system partition (/boot/efi), anaconda hard codes the value and ignores the users specified --fsoptions values. --label= - assign a label to an individual partition. --recommended - Determine the size of the partition automatically.

partition and swap space. It cannot be used to create LVM physical volumes or RAID members. --onbiosdisk - Forces the partition to be created on a particular disk as discovered by the BIOS. --encrypted - Specifies that this partition should be encrypted with Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS), using the passphrase provided in the --passphrase option. If you do not specify a passphrase, Anaconda uses the default, system-wide passphrase set with the autopart -- passphrase command, or stops the installation and prompts you to provide a passphrase if no default is set. NOTE When encrypting one or more partitions, Anaconda attempts to gather 256 bits of entropy to ensure the partitions are encrypted securely. Gathering entropy can take some time - the process will stop after a maximum of 10 minutes, regardless of whether sufficient entropy has been gathered. The process can be sped up by interacting with the installation system (typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse). If you are installing in a virtual machine, you can also attach a virtio-rng device (a virtual random number generator) to the guest. --luks-version=LUKS_VERSION - Specifies which version of LUKS format should be used to encrypt the filesystem. This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --passphrase= - Specifies the passphrase to use when encrypting this partition. You must use this option together with the --encrypted option; by itself it has no effect. --cipher= - Specifies the type of encryption to use if the Anaconda default aes-xts-plain64 is not satisfactory. You must use this option together with the --encrypted option; by itself it has Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 118 no effect. Available types of encryption are listed in the Security hardening document, but Red Hat strongly recommends using either aes-xts-plain64 or aes-cbc-essiv:sha256. --escrowcert=URL_of_X.509_certificate - Store data encryption keys of all encrypted partitions as files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate from the URL specified with URL_of_X.509_certificate.

option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --backuppassphrase - Add a randomly-generated passphrase to each encrypted partition. Store these passphrases in separate files in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate specified with --escrowcert. This option is only meaningful if --escrowcert is specified. --pbkdf=PBKDF - Sets Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) algorithm for LUKS keyslot. See also the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --pbkdf-memory=PBKDF_MEMORY - Sets the memory cost for PBKDF. See also the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --pbkdf-time=PBKDF_TIME - Sets the number of milliseconds to spend with PBKDF passphrase processing. See also --iter-time in the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified, and is mutually exclusive with --pbkdf-iterations. --pbkdf-iterations=PBKDF_ITERATIONS - Sets the number of iterations directly and avoids PBKDF benchmark. See also --pbkdf-force-iterations in the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified, and is mutually exclusive with --pbkdf- time. --resize= - Resize an existing partition. When using this option, specify the target size (in MiB) using the --size= option and the target partition using the --onpart= option. Notes The part command is not mandatory, but you must include either part, autopart or mount in your Kickstart script. If partitioning fails for any reason, diagnostic messages appear on virtual console 3. All partitions created are formatted as part of the installation process unless --noformat and -- onpart are used. The sdX (or /dev/sdX) format does not guarantee consistent device names across reboots, which can complicate the usage of some Kickstart commands.

This is especially useful in large storage environments. To explore the available device names on the system, you APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 119 can use the ls -lR /dev/disk command during the interactive installation. For more information about different ways to consistently refer to storage devices, see Overview of persistent naming attributes. If you lose the LUKS passphrase, any encrypted partitions and their data is completely inaccessible. There is no way to recover a lost passphrase. However, you can save encryption passphrases with the --escrowcert and create backup encryption passphrases with the -- backuppassphrase options. B.5.13. raid The raid Kickstart command is optional. It assembles a software RAID device. Syntax raid mntpoint --level=level --device=device-name partitions* Options mntpoint - Location where the RAID file system is mounted. If it is /, the RAID level must be 1 unless a boot partition (/boot) is present. If a boot partition is present, the /boot partition must be level 1 and the root (/) partition can be any of the available types. The partitions* (which denotes that multiple partitions can be listed) lists the RAID identifiers to add to the RAID array. IMPORTANT On IBM Power Systems, if a RAID device has been prepared and has not been reformatted during the installation, ensure that the RAID metadata version is 0.90 or 1.0 if you intend to put the /boot and PReP partitions on the RAID device.

for the /boot and PReP partitions. The PReP Boot partitions are not required on PowerNV systems. --level= - RAID level to use (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 10). --device= - Name of the RAID device to use - for example, --device=root. IMPORTANT Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 120 IMPORTANT Do not use mdraid names in the form of md0 - these names are not guaranteed to be persistent. Instead, use meaningful names such as root or swap. Using meaningful names creates a symbolic link from /dev/md/name to whichever /dev/mdX node is assigned to the array. If you have an old (v0.90 metadata) array that you cannot assign a name to, you can specify the array by a filesystem label or UUID. For example, -- device=LABEL=root or --device=UUID=93348e56-4631-d0f0-6f5b- 45c47f570b88. You can use the UUID of the file system on the RAID device or UUID of the RAID device itself. The UUID of the RAID device should be in the 8-4-4-4-12 format. UUID reported by mdadm is in the 8:8:8:8 format which needs to be changed. For example 93348e56:4631d0f0:6f5b45c4:7f570b88 should be changed to 93348e56-4631-d0f0-6f5b-45c47f570b88. --chunksize= - Sets the chunk size of a RAID storage in KiB. In certain situations, using a different chunk size than the default (512 Kib) can improve the performance of the RAID. --spares= - Specifies the number of spare drives allocated for the RAID array. Spare drives are used to rebuild the array in case of drive failure. --fsprofile= - Specifies a usage type to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition.

For this option to work, the filesystem must support the concept of usage types and there must be a configuration file that lists valid types. For ext2, ext3, and ext4, this configuration file is /etc/mke2fs.conf. --fstype= - Sets the file system type for the RAID array. Valid values are xfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, swap, and vfat. --fsoptions= - Specifies a free form string of options to be used when mounting the filesystem. This string will be copied into the /etc/fstab file of the installed system and should be enclosed in quotes. NOTE In the EFI system partition (/boot/efi), anaconda hard codes the value and ignores the users specified --fsoptions values. --mkfsoptions= - Specifies additional parameters to be passed to the program that makes a filesystem on this partition. No processing is done on the list of arguments, so they must be supplied in a format that can be passed directly to the mkfs program. This means multiple options should be comma-separated or surrounded by double quotes, depending on the filesystem. --label= - Specify the label to give to the filesystem to be made. If the given label is already in use by another filesystem, a new label will be created. --noformat - Use an existing RAID device and do not format the RAID array. --useexisting - Use an existing RAID device and reformat it. --encrypted - Specifies that this RAID device should be encrypted with Linux Unified Key Setup APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 121 (LUKS), using the passphrase provided in the --passphrase option. If you do not specify a passphrase, Anaconda uses the default, system-wide passphrase set with the autopart -- passphrase command, or stops the installation and prompts you to provide a passphrase if no default is set. NOTE When encrypting one or more partitions, Anaconda attempts to gather 256 bits of entropy to ensure the partitions are encrypted securely. Gathering entropy can take some time - the process will stop after a maximum of 10 minutes, regardless of whether sufficient entropy has been gathered.

process can be sped up by interacting with the installation system (typing on the keyboard or moving the mouse). If you are installing in a virtual machine, you can also attach a virtio-rng device (a virtual random number generator) to the guest. --luks-version=LUKS_VERSION - Specifies which version of LUKS format should be used to encrypt the filesystem. This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --cipher= - Specifies the type of encryption to use if the Anaconda default aes-xts-plain64 is not satisfactory. You must use this option together with the --encrypted option; by itself it has no effect. Available types of encryption are listed in the Security hardening document, but Red Hat strongly recommends using either aes-xts-plain64 or aes-cbc-essiv:sha256. --passphrase= - Specifies the passphrase to use when encrypting this RAID device. You must use this option together with the --encrypted option; by itself it has no effect. --escrowcert=URL_of_X.509_certificate - Store the data encryption key for this device in a file in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate from the URL specified with URL_of_X.509_certificate. This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --backuppassphrase - Add a randomly-generated passphrase to this device. Store the passphrase in a file in /root, encrypted using the X.509 certificate specified with --escrowcert. This option is only meaningful if --escrowcert is specified. --pbkdf=PBKDF - Sets Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) algorithm for LUKS keyslot. See also the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --pbkdf-memory=PBKDF_MEMORY - Sets the memory cost for PBKDF. See also the man page cryptsetup(8). This option is only meaningful if --encrypted is specified. --pbkdf-time=PBKDF_TIME - Sets the number of milliseconds to spend with PBKDF passphrase processing.

with BIOS firmware and GPT, and a PRePBoot partition for IBM Power Systems. Syntax reqpart [--add-boot] Options --add-boot - Creates a separate /boot partition in addition to the platform-specific partition created by the base command. Notes This command cannot be used toegether with autopart, because autopart does everything the reqpart command does and, in addition, creates other partitions or logical volumes such as / and swap. In contrast with autopart, this command only creates platform-specific partitions and leaves the rest of the drive empty, allowing you to create a custom layout. B.5.15. snapshot The snapshot Kickstart command is optional. Use it to create LVM thin volume snapshots during the installation process. This enables you to back up a logical volume before or after the installation. To create multiple snapshots, add the snaphost Kickstart command multiple times. Syntax APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 123 snapshot vg_name/lv_name --name=snapshot_name --when=pre-install|post-install Options vg_name/lv_name - Sets the name of the volume group and logical volume to create the snapshot from. --name=snapshot_name - Sets the name of the snapshot. This name must be unique within the volume group. --when=pre-install|post-install - Sets if the snapshot is created before the installation begins or after the installation is completed. B.5.16. volgroup The volgroup Kickstart command is optional. It creates a Logical Volume Management (LVM) group. Syntax volgroup name [OPTIONS] [partition*] Mandatory options name - Name of the new volume group. Options partition - Physical volume partitions to use as backing storage for the volume group. --noformat - Use an existing volume group and do not format it. --useexisting - Use an existing volume group and reformat it.

If this character is used, the installation finishes normally, but the /dev/mapper/ directory will list these volumes and volume groups with every dash doubled. For example, a volume group named volgrp-01 containing a logical volume named logvol-01 will be listed as /dev/mapper/volgrp--01-logvol--01. This limitation only applies to newly created logical volume and volume group names. If you are reusing existing ones using the --noformat option, their names will not be changed. B.5.17. zerombr The zerombr Kickstart command is optional. The zerombr initializes any invalid partition tables that are found on disks and destroys all of the contents of disks with invalid partition tables. This command is required when performing an installation on an 64-bit IBM Z system with unformatted Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) disks, otherwise the unformatted disks are not formatted and used during the installation. Syntax zerombr Notes On 64-bit IBM Z, if zerombr is specified, any Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) visible to the installation program which is not already low-level formatted is automatically low-level formatted with dasdfmt.

a non-interactive Kickstart installation exits unsuccessfully. If zerombr is not specified and there is at least one unformatted DASD visible to the installation program, an interactive installation exits if the user does not agree to format all visible and unformatted DASDs. To circumvent this, only activate those DASDs that you will use during installation. You can always add more DASDs after installation is complete. This command has no options. B.5.18. zfcp The zfcp Kickstart command is optional. It defines a Fibre channel device. This option only applies on 64-bit IBM Z. Syntax zfcp --devnum=devnum [--wwpn=wwpn --fcplun=lun] Options --devnum= - The device number (zFCP adapter device bus ID). --wwpn= - The device’s World Wide Port Name (WWPN). Takes the form of a 16-digit number, preceded by 0x. --fcplun= - The device’s Logical Unit Number (LUN). Takes the form of a 16-digit number, APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 125 --fcplun= - The device’s Logical Unit Number (LUN). Takes the form of a 16-digit number, preceded by 0x. NOTE It is sufficient to specify an FCP device bus ID if automatic LUN scanning is available and when installing 9 or later releases. Otherwise all three parameters are required. Automatic LUN scanning is available for FCP devices operating in NPIV mode if it is not disabled through the zfcp.allow_lun_scan module parameter (enabled by default). It provides access to all SCSI devices found in the storage area network attached to the FCP device with the specified bus ID.

Kickstart commands in this section are related to add-ons supplied by default with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation program: Kdump and OpenSCAP. B.6.1. %addon com_redhat_kdump The %addon com_redhat_kdump Kickstart command is optional. This command configures the kdump kernel crash dumping mechanism. Syntax %addon com_redhat_kdump [OPTIONS] %end NOTE The syntax for this command is unusual because it is an add-on rather than a built-in Kickstart command. Notes Kdump is a kernel crash dumping mechanism that allows you to save the contents of the system’s memory for later analysis. It relies on kexec, which can be used to boot a Linux kernel from the context of another kernel without rebooting the system, and preserve the contents of the first kernel’s memory that would otherwise be lost. In case of a system crash, kexec boots into a second kernel (a capture kernel). This capture kernel resides in a reserved part of the system memory. Kdump then captures the contents of the crashed kernel’s memory (a crash dump) and saves it to a specified location. The location cannot be configured using this Kickstart command; it must be configured after the installation by editing the /etc/kdump.conf configuration file. For more information about Kdump, see the Installing kdump chapter of the Managing, monitoring and updating the kernel document. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation 126 Options --enable - Enable kdump on the installed system. --disable - Disable kdump on the installed system. --reserve-mb= - The amount of memory you want to reserve for kdump, in MiB. For example: %addon com_redhat_kdump --enable --reserve-mb=128 %end You can also specify auto instead of a numeric value. In that case, the installation program will determine the amount of memory automatically based on the criteria described in the Memory requirements for kdump section of the Managing, monitoring and updating the kernel document.

Systems servers). B.6.2. %addon com_redhat_oscap The %addon com_redhat_oscap Kickstart command is optional. The OpenSCAP installation program add-on is used to apply SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) content - security policies - on the installed system. This add-on has been enabled by default since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2. When enabled, the packages necessary to provide this functionality will automatically be installed. However, by default, no policies are enforced, meaning that no checks are performed during or after installation unless specifically configured. IMPORTANT Applying a security policy is not necessary on all systems. This command should only be used when a specific policy is mandated by your organization rules or government regulations. Unlike most other commands, this add-on does not accept regular options, but uses key-value pairs in the body of the %addon definition instead. These pairs are whitespace-agnostic. Values can be optionally enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). Syntax %addon com_redhat_oscap key = value %end Keys The following keys are recognized by the add-on: content-type Type of the security content. Possible values are datastream, archive, rpm, and scap-security- guide. If the content-type is scap-security-guide, the add-on will use content provided by the scap- APPENDIX B. KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 127 If the content-type is scap-security-guide, the add-on will use content provided by the scap- security-guide package, which is present on the boot media. This means that all other keys except profile will have no effect. content-url Location of the security content. The content must be accessible using HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP; local storage is currently not supported. A network connection must be available to reach content definitions in a remote location. datastream-id ID of the data stream referenced in the content-url value.

COMMANDS USED IN ANACONDA The pwpolicy command is an Anaconda UI specific command that can be used only in the %anaconda section of the kickstart file. B.7.1. pwpolicy (deprecated) The pwpolicy Kickstart command is optional. Use this command to enforce a custom password policy during installation. The policy requires you to create passwords for the root, users, or the luks user accounts. The factors such as password length and strength decide the validity of a password.

KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS REFERENCE 129 The pwpolicy command is an Anaconda-UI specific command that can be used only in the %anaconda section of the kickstart file. The libpwquality library is used to check minimum password requirements (length and quality). You can use the pwscore and pwmake commands provided by the libpwquality package to check the quality score of a password, or to create a random password with a given score. See the pwscore(1) and pwmake(1) man page for details about these commands. B.8. KICKSTART COMMANDS FOR SYSTEM RECOVERY The Kickstart command in this section repairs an installed system.

file systems as read-only Blocklist or add a driver provided on a driver disc Install or upgrade system packages Manage partitions NOTE The Kickstart rescue mode is different from the rescue mode and emergency mode, which are provided as part of the systemd and service manager. The rescue command does not modify the system on its own. It only sets up the rescue environment by mounting the system under /mnt/sysimage in a read-write mode. You can choose not to mount the system, or to mount it in read-only mode. Syntax rescue [--nomount|--romount] Options --nomount or --romount - Controls how the installed system is mounted in the rescue environment. By default, the installation program finds your system and mount it in read-write mode, telling you where it has performed this mount. You can optionally select to not mount anything (the --nomount option) or mount in read-only mode (the --romount option). Only one of these two options can be used. Notes To run a rescue mode, make a copy of the Kickstart file, and include the rescue command in it. Using the rescue command causes the installer to perform the following steps: 1. Run the %pre script. 2. Set up environment for rescue mode.
