Apple Watch for a family member\nSet up a family member’s Apple Watch\nYou can set up and manage Apple Watch for someone who doesn’t have their own iPhone—\nyour school-aged child or parent, for example. To do so, you must be the family organizer\nor parent/guardian in your Family Sharing group.\nThe iPhone you use to initially pair and set up the Apple Watch must be within normal\nBluetooth range (about 33 feet or 10 meters) of the Apple Watch to manage settings and\nupdate the software. The person you set up Apple Watch for must be part of your Family\nSharing group and have a cellular-capable Apple Watch SE or Apple Watch Series 4 or\nlater. (Your family member’s watch doesn’t have to use the same cellular carrier as the\niPhone you manage it with.) See the iPhone User Guide for information about setting up\nFamily Sharing.\nNote: Family setup is not available in all regions.\nUsing the Apple Watch app and Screen Time on your iPhone, you can manage the\nfollowing:\n• Communications limits and safety\n• A schedule for time away from the screen\n• Schooltime—a feature that limits certain Apple Watch features during school hours\n• Mail and calendar settings for iCloud, Gmail, and other services\n• Restriction settings for explicit content, purchases, and privacy\nIn addition, you can view Activity, Health, and Location information for the managed\nApple Watch based on how it’s set up.\nNote: An Apple Watch set up for a family member is limited in some of its interactions\nwith the iPhone used to set it up. For example, you can’t unlock a paired iPhone from an\nApple Watch you set up for a family member, nor can you hand off tasks from the managed\nApple Watch to the iPhone. If you delete an app from an Apple Watch set up for a family\nmember, it’s not also removed from the iPhone used to set it up.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"VvDeBO+Z7rI1JszVI3cZOwcjb69t2nEdb0i0JX+Ey9E="},"a32b91d7-cdca-49c3-80b8-1fa5aa6c9062":{"id_":"a32b91d7-cdca-49c3-80b8-1fa5aa6c9062","metadata":{"page_number":50,"total_pages":394,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf","file_name":"apple-watch.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./datasources/watchos/apple-watch.pdf_50","metadata":{"page_number":50,"total_pages":394,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf","file_name":"apple-watch.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"JW7KHDzERCuiqgORYvS3LpYoM51GvKDCvwc+ebz3reA="}},"text":"file_name: apple-watch.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf\npage_number: 50\nprivate: false\ntotal_pages: 394\n\n50Apple Watch User Guide\nSet up your family member’s Apple Watch\nSetting up an Apple Watch for a family member is similar to setting up a watch for yourself.\nBefore you pair and set up a watch for your family member, erase the watch to ensure that\nit doesn’t have any content.\n1.

Crash Detection on Apple Watch\nIf your Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Series 9, or Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation)\ndetects a severe car crash, it can help connect you to emergency services and notify your\nemergency contacts.\nWhen your Apple Watch detects a severe car crash, it will display an alert and\nautomatically initiate an emergency phone call after 20 seconds unless you cancel. If you\nare unresponsive, it will play an audio message for emergency services, which informs\nthem that you’ve been in a severe car crash and gives them your latitudinal and longitudinal\ncoordinates with an approximate search radius.\nTo call emergency services, your Apple Watch or nearby iPhone needs a cellular\nconnection, or needs to have Wi-Fi calling turned on and Wi-Fi coverage available.\nIf cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, and your iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 Pro or\nlater is near your Apple Watch, Crash Detection notifications to emergency services may\nbe communicated by the Emergency SOS via satellite system, where Emergency SOS via\nsatellite is available. See the Apple Support article Use Emergency SOS via satellite on your\niPhone.\nNote: When a severe car crash is detected, Crash Detection won’t override any existing\nemergency calls placed by other means.\nTurn Crash Detection on or off\nCrash Detection is on by default. You can turn off alerts and automatic emergency calls\nfrom Apple after a severe car crash by following these steps:\n1. Open the Settings app on your Apple Watch.\n2. Go to SOS > Crash Detection, then turn off Call After Severe Crash.\nFor more information, see the Apple Support article Use Crash Detection on iPhone or\nApple Watch to call for help in an accident.\nNote: Apple Watch cannot detect all car crashes.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ppgJ8ZQ4YUPBufr/mulUdPsK90azPIetXu9T4RgkVTE="},"8f00a9cc-64e9-4d9d-b725-2f659f613284":{"id_":"8f00a9cc-64e9-4d9d-b725-2f659f613284","metadata":{"page_number":106,"total_pages":394,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf","file_name":"apple-watch.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./datasources/watchos/apple-watch.pdf_106","metadata":{"page_number":106,"total_pages":394,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf","file_name":"apple-watch.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"ifkUu+RtjvYOtDZKMc8Ko5zp47YQGqFZR5eSWkfWqMU="}},"text":"file_name: apple-watch.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf\npage_number: 106\nprivate: false\ntotal_pages: 394\n\n106Apple Watch User Guide\nSiri\nUse Siri on Apple Watch\nUseful Siri commands\nYou can use Siri to perform tasks and get answers right on your Apple Watch.

Wear your watch to bed, and Apple Watch can estimate the time you\nspent in each sleep stage—REM, Core, and Deep—as well as when you might have woken\nup. When you wake up, open the Sleep app to learn how much sleep you got and see your\nsleep trends over the past 14 days.\nAsk Siri. On Apple Watch Series 9 using watchOS 10.2 or later, say something like:\n“How much did I sleep last night?” (Not available in all languages or regions.)\nIf your Apple Watch is charged less than 30 percent before you go to bed, you’re prompted\nto charge it. In the morning, just glance at the greeting to see how much charge remains.\nNote: Apple Watch tracks your sleep based on the sleep schedule you create. Apple Watch\ncan also track your sleep when your Sleep Focus starts. To receive sleep data from\nApple Watch, it must track your sleep for at least four hours each night.\nYou can create multiple schedules—for example, one for weekdays and another for\nweekends. For each schedule, you can set up the following:\n• A sleep goal (how many hours of sleep you want to get)\n• What time you want to go to bed and wake up\n• An alarm sound to wake you up\n• When to turn on the Sleep Focus, which limits distractions before you go to bed and\nprotects your sleep after you’re in bed\n• Sleep tracking, which uses your motion to detect sleep when you wear Apple Watch to\nbed and the Sleep Focus is active\nNote: Sleep tracking is available on watchOS 8 or later.\nTip: To turn off the Sleep Focus, press and hold the Digital Crown to unlock, press the\nside button to open Control Center, then tap .","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"SjqlfZXhZN1WMV/WUysp34bEd6exmqMM/RhnbpyLz0g="},"5a88e9b7-fdc1-4869-9d54-e25a1b95b734":{"id_":"5a88e9b7-fdc1-4869-9d54-e25a1b95b734","metadata":{"page_number":296,"total_pages":394,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf","file_name":"apple-watch.pdf","private":"false"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./datasources/watchos/apple-watch.pdf_296","metadata":{"page_number":296,"total_pages":394,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf","file_name":"apple-watch.pdf","private":"false"},"hash":"YEOBGYzIJTwIY2wU5GvJQ4JI69hIUtto5s8oW9C8790="}},"text":"file_name: apple-watch.pdf\nfile_path: C:\\Users\\thucpn\\Desktop\\chat-llamaindex\\datasources\\watchos\\apple-watch.pdf\npage_number: 296\nprivate: false\ntotal_pages: 394\n\n296Apple Watch User Guide\nSet up Sleep on Apple Watch\n1.

and\nfasten Apple Watch bands.• Wipe Apple Watch clean with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth.If necessary, you can also\nlightly dampen the cloth with fresh water.• Dry Apple Watch with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth.To help avoid damaging Apple Watch, observe the following:\n• Don’t clean Apple Watch while it’s charging.• Don’t dry Apple Watch or the bands using any external heat source (for example,\na hair dryer).• Don’t use cleaning products, ultrasonic cleaners, or compressed air when cleaning your\nApple Watch.• Don’t insert objects into any opening or port on Apple Watch.The front of Apple Watch is made of Ion-X glass (strengthened glass)or sapphire crystal,\neach with a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic (oil repellent)coating.This coating wears over\ntime with normal usage.Cleaning products and abrasive materials will further diminish the\ncoating, and may scratch the glass or the sapphire crystal.Using buttons, Digital Crown, connectors, and ports Never apply excessive pressure\nto a button or the Digital Crown on Apple Watch, or force a charging connector into\na port, because this may cause damage that is not covered under the warranty.If the\nconnector and port don’t join with reasonable ease, they probably don’t match.Check\nfor obstructions and make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have\npositioned the connector correctly in relation to the port.Certain usage patterns can contribute to the fraying or breaking of cables.The cable\nattached to a charging unit, like any other metal wire or cable, is subject to becoming weak\nor brittle if repeatedly bent in the same

security vulnerabilities, instability, and shortened battery life to the hacked\nApple Watch.• Security vulnerabilities.Jailbreaking your device eliminates security layers designed\nto protect your personal information and your Apple Watch.With this security removed\nfrom your Apple Watch, hackers may steal your personal information, damage your\ndevice, attack your network, or introduce malware, spyware, or viruses.• Instability.Unauthorized modifications can cause frequent and unexpected crashes of\nthe device, crashes and freezes of built-in apps and third-party apps, and loss of data.• Shortened battery life.Hacked software can cause an accelerated battery drain that\nshortens the operation of Apple Watch on a single battery charge.• Unreliable voice and data.Unauthorized modifications can cause dropped calls,\nslow or unreliable data connections, and delayed or inaccurate location data.• Disruption of services.Services such as iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, Apple Pay,\nVisual Voicemail, Weather, and Stocks may be disrupted or no longer work on the\ndevice.Additionally, third-party apps that use the Apple Push Notification Service may\nexperience difficulty receiving notifications or may receive notifications intended for a\ndifferent device.Other push-based services, such as iCloud and Exchange,\nmay experience problems syncing data with their
