Welcome to [Unc](https://unc.de). A robust, scalable open-source platform built specifically for implementing privacy-first, enterprise-level ChatGPT.

Getting started with Unc is a breeze. Visit [unc.de](https://unc.de) - a hosted version of Unc with no user authentication, provides an immediate start.

## üöÄ Features

Unc is enterprise-ready, featuring:

- Self-hosted, can be installed in own cloud (private or public).
- Chat with your own HTML and PDF documents.
- Create bots using prompt engineering (no-code) and share them with other users. This avoids the repetition of frequently used prompts.
- Supports [Azure OpenAI from Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), eliminating traffic to OpenAI.
- Privacy first; personal data is stored locally in the browser.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/marcusschiesser/unc)

### Local Development

Requirement: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) 18

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcusschiesser/unc
cd unc
```

- Run the dev server

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Recreate Storage

The app is using a [`ChatEngine`](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/modules/high_level/chat_engine) for each bot with a different [`VectorStoreIndex`](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/modules/high_level/data_index) attached.
The `cache` folder in the file system is used as [Storage](The https://ts.llamaindex.ai/modules/low_level/storage) for the `VectorStoreIndex`. To re-create the storage 
Vector Indexes 
```bash
pnpm run generate
```
