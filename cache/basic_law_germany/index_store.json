establishment of the requisite authorities and regulate their administrative procedures. If federal laws provide otherwise, the <i>L�nder</i> may enact derogating regulations. If a <i>Land</i> has enacted a derogating regulation pursuant to the second sentence, subsequent federal statutory provisions regulating the organisation of authorities and their administrative procedure shall not be enacted until at least six months after their promulgation, provided that no other determination has been made with the consent of the Bundesrat. The third sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 72 shall apply, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.

regulation of details, especially the adjustment of revenue and expenditures with regard to financial transactions and the procedure for the calculation of the yearly limit on net borrowing, taking into account the economic cycle on the basis of a procedure for adjusting the cycle together with the control and balancing of deviations of actual borrowing from the credit limit, requires a federal law. In cases of natural catastrophes or unusual emergency situations beyond governmental control and substantially harmful to the state�s financial capacity, these credit limits may be exceeded on the basis of a decision taken by a majority of the Members of the Bundestag. The decision must be combined with an amortisation plan. Repayment of the credits borrowed under the sixth sentence must be accomplished within an appropriate period of time. </p><p style=\"text-align: left; font-weight: normal\"><a href=\"https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/index.html#gl_p0683\">table of contents</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold\"><a name=\"p0683\"><!----></a>Xa.
