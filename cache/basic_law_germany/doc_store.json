Registration is performed\\n\\nafter the installation completes. This installation method is supported by the GUI and Kickstart.\\n\\nRegister and install RHEL from the Content Delivery Network:\\nRegister your system, attach\\n\\nsubscriptions, and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux from the Content Delivery Network (CDN).\\n\\nThis installation method supports\\n \\nBoot ISO\\n \\nand\\n \\nDVD ISO\\n \\nimage files; however, the\\n \\nBoot ISO\\n\\nimage file is recommended as the installation source defaults to CDN for the Boot ISO image\\n\\nfile. After registering the system, the installer downloads and installs packages from the CDN.\\n\\nThis installation method is also supported by Kickstart.\\n\\nPerform a remote RHEL installation using VNC:\\n \\nThe RHEL installation program offers two\\n\\nVirtual Network Computing (VNC) installation modes: Direct and Connect. After a connection is\\n\\nestablished, the two modes do not differ. The mode you select depends on your environment.\\n\\nInstall RHEL from the network using PXE :\\nWith a network installation using preboot execution\\n\\nenvironment (PXE), you can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux to a system that has access to an\\n\\ninstallation server. At a minimum, two systems are required for a network installation.\\n\\nSystem or cloud image-based installations\\n\\nYou can use system or cloud image-based installation methods only in virtual and cloud environments.\\n\\nTo perform a system or cloud image-based installation, use Red Hat Image Builder.

KICKSTART INSTALLATION BASICS\\n\\nThe following provides basic information about Kickstart and how to use it to automate installing\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux.\\n\\n3.1. WHAT ARE KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS\\n\\nKickstart provides a way to automate the RHEL installation process, either partially or fully.\\n\\nKickstart files contain some or all of the RHEL installation options. For example, the time zone, how the\\n\\ndrives should be partitioned, or which packages should be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file\\n\\nallows an installation without the need for any user intervention. This is especially useful when deploying\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux on a large number of systems at once.\\n\\nKickstart files also provide more options regarding software selection. When installing Red Hat\\n\\nEnterprise Linux manually using the graphical installation interface, the software selection is limited to\\n\\npre-defined environments and add-ons. A Kickstart file allows you to install or remove individual\\n\\npackages as well.\\n\\nKickstart files can be kept on a single server system and read by individual computers during the\\n\\ninstallation. This installation method supports the use of a single Kickstart file to install Red Hat\\n\\nEnterprise Linux on multiple machines, making it ideal for network and system administrators.\\n\\nAll Kickstart scripts and log files of their execution are stored in the\\n \\n/tmp\\n \\ndirectory of the newly installed\\n\\nsystem to assist with debugging installation issues. The kickstart used for installation as well as the\\n\\nAnaconda generated output kickstart are stored in\\n \\n/root\\n \\non the target system and that logs from\\n\\nkickstart scriptlet execution are stored in\\n \\n/var/log/anaconda\\n.\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nIn previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Kickstart could be used for upgrading\\n\\nsystems. Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, this functionality has been removed\\n\\nand system upgrades are instead handled by specialized tools. For details on upgrading to\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9, see\\n \\nUpgrading from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9\\n \\nand\\n \\nConsiderations in\\n\\nadopting RHEL\\n.\\n\\n3.2.

UPDATING DRIVERS DURING INSTALLATION\\n\\nThis section describes how to complete a driver update during the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation\\n\\nprocess.\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nThis is an optional step of the installation process. Red Hat recommends that you do not\\n\\nperform a driver update unless it is necessary.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nYou have been notified by Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third-party vendor that a\\n\\ndriver update is required during Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation.\\n\\n14.1. OVERVIEW\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux supports drivers for many hardware devices but some newly-released drivers\\n\\nmay not be supported. A driver update should only be performed if an unsupported driver prevents the\\n\\ninstallation from completing. Updating drivers during installation is typically only required to support a\\n\\nparticular configuration. For example, installing drivers for a storage adapter card that provides access\\n\\nto your system’s storage devices.\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nDriver update disks may disable conflicting kernel drivers. In rare cases, unloading a\\n\\nkernel module may cause installation errors.\\n\\n14.2. TYPES OF DRIVER UPDATE\\n\\nRed Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third party provides the driver update as an ISO image file.\\n\\nOnce you receive the ISO image file, choose the type of driver update.\\n\\nTypes of driver update\\n\\nAutomatic\\n\\nThe recommended driver update method; a storage device (including a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive)\\n\\nlabeled\\n \\nOEMDRV\\n \\nis physically connected to the system. If the\\n \\nOEMDRV\\n \\nstorage device is present\\n\\nwhen the installation starts, it is treated as a driver update disk, and the installation program\\n\\nautomatically loads its drivers.\\n\\nAssisted\\n\\nThe installation program prompts you to locate a driver update. You can use any local storage device\\n\\nwith a label other than\\n \\nOEMDRV\\n. The\\n \\ninst.dd\\n \\nboot option is specified when starting the installation. If\\n\\nyou use this option without any parameters, the installation program displays all of the storage\\n\\ndevices connected to the system, and prompts you to select a device that contains a driver update.\\n\\nManual\\n\\nManually specify a path to a driver update image or an RPM package.

The\\n \\ninst.dd=location\\n \\nboot option is specified when starting the installation, where\\n \\nlocation\\n \\nis\\n\\nthe path to a driver update disk or ISO image. When you specify this option, the installation program\\n\\nattempts to load any driver updates found at the specified location. With manual driver updates, you\\n\\ncan specify local storage devices, or a network location (HTTP, HTTPS or FTP server).\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nYou can use both\\n \\ninst.dd=location\\n \\nand\\n \\ninst.dd\\n \\nsimultaneously, where\\n \\nlocation\\n \\nis\\n\\nthe path to a driver update disk or ISO image. In this scenario, the installation\\n\\nprogram attempts to load any available driver updates from the location and also\\n\\nprompts you to select a device that contains the driver update.\\n\\nLimitations\\n\\nOn UEFI systems with the Secure Boot technology enabled, all drivers must be signed with a valid\\n\\ncertificate. Red Hat drivers are signed by one of Red Hat’s private keys and authenticated by its\\n\\ncorresponding public key in the kernel. If you load additional, separate drivers, verify that they are\\n\\nsigned.\\n\\n14.3. PREPARING A DRIVER UPDATE\\n\\nThis procedure describes how to prepare a driver update on a CD and DVD.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n\\nYou have received the driver update ISO image from Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a\\n\\ntrusted third-party vendor.\\n\\nYou have burned the driver update ISO image to a CD or DVD.\\n\\nWARNING\\n\\nIf only a single ISO image file ending in\\n \\n.iso\\n \\nis available on the CD or DVD, the burn\\n\\nprocess has not been successful. See your system’s burning software\\n\\ndocumentation for instructions on how to burn ISO images to a CD or DVD.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\n1\\n.\\n \\nInsert the driver update CD or DVD into your system’s CD/DVD drive, and browse it using the\\n\\nsystem’s file manager tool.\\n\\n2\\n.\\n \\nVerify that a single file\\n \\nrhdd3\\n \\nis available.\\n \\nrhdd3\\n \\nis a signature file that contains the driver\\n\\ndescription and a directory named\\n \\nrpms\\n, which contains the RPM packages with the actual\\n\\ndrivers for various architectures.\\n\\n14.4.

KICKSTART SCRIPT FILE FORMAT REFERENCE\\n\\nThis reference describes in detail the kickstart file format.\\n\\nA.1. KICKSTART FILE FORMAT\\n\\nKickstart scripts are plain text files that contain keywords recognized by the installation program, which\\n\\nserve as directions for the installation. Any text editor able to save files as ASCII text, such as\\n \\nGedit\\n \\nor\\n\\nvim\\n \\non Linux systems or\\n \\nNotepad\\n \\non Windows systems, can be used to create and edit Kickstart files.\\n\\nThe file name of your Kickstart configuration does not matter; however, it is recommended to use a\\n\\nsimple name as you will need to specify this name later in other configuration files or dialogs.\\n\\nCommands\\n\\nCommands are keywords that serve as directions for installation. Each command must be on a single\\n\\nline. Commands can take options. Specifying commands and options is similar to using Linux\\n\\ncommands in shell.\\n\\nSections\\n\\nCertain special commands that begin with the percent\\n \\n%\\n \\ncharacter start a section. Interpretation of\\n\\ncommands in sections is different from commands placed outside sections. Every section must be\\n\\nfinished with\\n \\n%end\\n \\ncommand.\\n\\nSection types\\n\\nThe available sections are:\\n\\nAdd-on sections\\n. These sections use the\\n \\n%addon\\n \\naddon_name\\n \\ncommand.\\n\\nPackage selection sections\\n. Starts with\\n \\n%packages\\n. Use it to list packages for installation,\\n\\nincluding indirect means such as package groups or modules.\\n\\nScript sections\\n. These start with\\n \\n%pre\\n,\\n \\n%pre-install\\n,\\n \\n%post\\n, and\\n \\n%onerror\\n. These sections\\n\\nare not required.\\n\\nCommand section\\n\\nThe command section is a term used for the commands in the Kickstart file that are not part of any\\n\\nscript section or\\n \\n%packages\\n \\nsection.\\n\\nScript section count and ordering\\n\\nAll sections except the command section are optional and can be present multiple times. When a\\n\\nparticular type of script section is to be evaluated, all sections of that type present in the Kickstart\\n\\nare evaluated in order of appearance: two\\n \\n%post\\n \\nsections are evaluated one after another, in the\\n\\norder as they appear. However, you do not have to specify the various types of script sections in any\\n\\norder: it does not matter if there are\\n \\n%post\\n \\nsections before\\n \\n%pre\\n \\nsections.\\n\\nComments\\n\\nKickstart comments are lines starting with the hash\\n \\n#\\n \\ncharacter. These lines are ignored by the\\n\\ninstallation program.\\n\\nItems that are not required can be omitted. Omitting any required item results in the installation\\n\\nprogram changing to the interactive mode so that the user can provide an answer to the related item,\\n\\njust as during a regular interactive installation. It is also possible to declare the kickstart script as non-\\n\\ninteractive with the\\n \\ncmdline\\n \\ncommand. In non-interactive mode, any missing answer aborts the\\n\\ninstallation process.\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation\\n\\n58\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"rsHtrjiJpzHToi1oehmpHlVCa50QA8/oumjpM8Im/QE=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"05817d94-ff11-4fae-a407-3ad7495acc9c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"05817d94-ff11-4fae-a407-3ad7495acc9c\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":62,\"total_pages\":136},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"NOTE\\n\\nIf user interaction is needed during kickstart installation in text or graphical mode, enter\\n\\nonly the windows where updates are mandatory to complete the installation.

INSTALLATION METHODS\\n\\nDepending on your requirements, you can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux using several methods. Review the following sections to determine the best installation method for your requirements. 2.1. AVAILABLE INSTALLATION METHODS\\n\\nYou can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux using any of the following methods:\\n\\nGUI-based installations\\n\\nSystem or cloud image-based installations\\n\\nAdvanced installations\\n\\nGUI-based installations\\n\\nYou can choose from the following GUI-based installation methods:\\n\\nInstall RHEL using an ISO image from the Customer Portal:\\nInstall Red Hat Enterprise Linux\\n\\nby downloading the\\n \\nDVD ISO\\n \\nimage file from the Customer Portal. Registration is performed\\n\\nafter the installation completes. This installation method is supported by the GUI and Kickstart. Register and install RHEL from the Content Delivery Network:\\nRegister your system, attach\\n\\nsubscriptions, and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux from the Content Delivery Network (CDN). This installation method supports\\n \\nBoot ISO\\n \\nand\\n \\nDVD ISO\\n \\nimage files; however, the\\n \\nBoot ISO\\n\\nimage file is recommended as the installation source defaults to CDN for the Boot ISO image\\n\\nfile. After registering the system, the installer downloads and installs packages from the CDN. This installation method is also supported by Kickstart. Perform a remote RHEL installation using VNC:\\n \\nThe RHEL installation program offers two\\n\\nVirtual Network Computing (VNC) installation modes: Direct and Connect. After a connection is\\n\\nestablished, the two modes do not differ. The mode you select depends on your environment. Install RHEL from the network using PXE :\\nWith a network installation using preboot execution\\n\\nenvironment (PXE), you can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux to a system that has access to an\\n\\ninstallation server. At a minimum, two systems are required for a network installation. System or cloud image-based installations\\n\\nYou can use system or cloud image-based installation methods only in virtual and cloud environments. To perform a system or cloud image-based installation, use Red Hat Image Builder. Image builder\\n\\ncreates customized system images of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including the system images for cloud\\n\\ndeployment. For more information about installing RHEL using Image builder, see\\n \\nComposing a customized RHEL\\n\\nsystem image\\n.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"eqBlvvaV3Nyk7wAMhyH+HSzSgf8xkPEtVMvME2sfNd0=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9c89e05f-e3ae-4bfa-9eb6-7b515d409fb4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9c89e05f-e3ae-4bfa-9eb6-7b515d409fb4\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":136},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"f7577621-898d-4a4e-b218-0ef448aaa0f9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":136},\"hash\":\"mr0lQIuYaqV+0LC/vVhnqwgWAb/u9MG0/T3uGMrV6us=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"7e105adc-ea0e-4433-93cd-84b6de467ac0\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":12,\"total_pages\":136},\"hash\":\"eqBlvvaV3Nyk7wAMhyH+HSzSgf8xkPEtVMvME2sfNd0=\"}},\"text\":\"Advanced installations\\n\\nYou can choose from the following advanced installation methods:\\n\\nPerform an automated RHEL installation using Kickstart:\\n \\nKickstart is an automated process\\n\\nthat helps you install the operating system by specifying all your requirements and\\n\\nconfigurations in a file.

KICKSTART INSTALLATION BASICS\\n\\nThe following provides basic information about Kickstart and how to use it to automate installing\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux. 3.1. WHAT ARE KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS\\n\\nKickstart provides a way to automate the RHEL installation process, either partially or fully. Kickstart files contain some or all of the RHEL installation options. For example, the time zone, how the\\n\\ndrives should be partitioned, or which packages should be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file\\n\\nallows an installation without the need for any user intervention. This is especially useful when deploying\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux on a large number of systems at once. Kickstart files also provide more options regarding software selection. When installing Red Hat\\n\\nEnterprise Linux manually using the graphical installation interface, the software selection is limited to\\n\\npre-defined environments and add-ons. A Kickstart file allows you to install or remove individual\\n\\npackages as well. Kickstart files can be kept on a single server system and read by individual computers during the\\n\\ninstallation. This installation method supports the use of a single Kickstart file to install Red Hat\\n\\nEnterprise Linux on multiple machines, making it ideal for network and system administrators. All Kickstart scripts and log files of their execution are stored in the\\n \\n/tmp\\n \\ndirectory of the newly installed\\n\\nsystem to assist with debugging installation issues. The kickstart used for installation as well as the\\n\\nAnaconda generated output kickstart are stored in\\n \\n/root\\n \\non the target system and that logs from\\n\\nkickstart scriptlet execution are stored in\\n \\n/var/log/anaconda\\n. NOTE\\n\\nIn previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Kickstart could be used for upgrading\\n\\nsystems. Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, this functionality has been removed\\n\\nand system upgrades are instead handled by specialized tools. For details on upgrading to\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9, see\\n \\nUpgrading from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9\\n \\nand\\n \\nConsiderations in\\n\\nadopting RHEL\\n. 3.2.

CREATING KICKSTART FILES\\n\\nYou can create a Kickstart file using the following methods:\\n\\nUse the online Kickstart configuration tool. Copy the Kickstart file created as a result of a manual installation. Write the entire Kickstart file manually. Convert the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Kickstart file for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 installation. For more information about the conversion tool, see\\n \\nKickstart generator lab\\n \\n. In case of virtual and cloud environment, create a custom system image, using Image Builder. Note that some highly specific installation options can be configured only by manual editing of the\\n\\nKickstart file. 4.1. CREATING A KICKSTART FILE WITH THE KICKSTART\\n\\nCONFIGURATION TOOL\\n\\nUsers with a Red Hat Customer Portal account can use the Kickstart Generator tool in the Customer\\n\\nPortal Labs to generate Kickstart files online.

CREATING INSTALLATION SOURCES FOR\\n\\nKICKSTART INSTALLATIONS\\n\\nThis section describes how to create an installation source for the Boot ISO image using the DVD ISO\\n\\nimage that contains the required repositories and software packages. 6.1. TYPES OF INSTALLATION SOURCE\\n\\nYou can use one of the following installation sources for minimal boot images:\\n\\nDVD:\\n \\nBurn the DVD ISO image to a DVD. The DVD will be automatically used as the installation\\n\\nsource (software package source). Disk or USB drive:\\n \\nCopy the DVD ISO image to the disk and configure the installation program\\n\\nto install the software packages from the drive. If you use a USB drive, verify that it is connected\\n\\nto the system before the installation begins. The installation program cannot detect media\\n\\nafter the installation begins. Disk limitation\\n: The DVD ISO image on the disk must be on a partition with a file system\\n\\nthat the installation program can mount. The supported file systems are\\n \\nxfs\\n,\\n \\next2\\n,\\n \\next3\\n,\\n\\next4\\n, and\\n \\nvfat (FAT32)\\n. WARNING\\n\\nOn Microsoft Windows systems, the default file system used when\\n\\nformatting disks is NTFS. The exFAT file system is also available. However,\\n\\nneither of these file systems can be mounted during the installation. If you\\n\\nare creating a disk or a USB drive as an installation source on Microsoft\\n\\nWindows, verify that you formatted the drive as FAT32. Note that the\\n\\nFAT32 file system cannot store files larger than 4 GiB. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, you can enable installation from a directory\\n\\non a local disk. To do so, you need to copy the contents of the DVD ISO\\n\\nimage to a directory on a disk and then specify the directory as the\\n\\ninstallation source instead of the ISO image. For example:\\n \\ninst.repo=hd:\\n\\n<device>:<path to the directory>\\n\\nNetwork location:\\n \\nCopy the DVD ISO image or the installation tree (extracted contents of the\\n\\nDVD ISO image) to a network location and perform the installation over the network using the\\n\\nfollowing protocols:\\n\\nNFS:\\n \\nThe DVD ISO image is in a Network File System (NFS) share.

UPDATING DRIVERS DURING INSTALLATION\\n\\nThis section describes how to complete a driver update during the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation\\n\\nprocess. NOTE\\n\\nThis is an optional step of the installation process. Red Hat recommends that you do not\\n\\nperform a driver update unless it is necessary. Prerequisites\\n\\nYou have been notified by Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third-party vendor that a\\n\\ndriver update is required during Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation. 14.1. OVERVIEW\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux supports drivers for many hardware devices but some newly-released drivers\\n\\nmay not be supported. A driver update should only be performed if an unsupported driver prevents the\\n\\ninstallation from completing. Updating drivers during installation is typically only required to support a\\n\\nparticular configuration. For example, installing drivers for a storage adapter card that provides access\\n\\nto your system’s storage devices. WARNING\\n\\nDriver update disks may disable conflicting kernel drivers. In rare cases, unloading a\\n\\nkernel module may cause installation errors. 14.2. TYPES OF DRIVER UPDATE\\n\\nRed Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third party provides the driver update as an ISO image file. Once you receive the ISO image file, choose the type of driver update. Types of driver update\\n\\nAutomatic\\n\\nThe recommended driver update method; a storage device (including a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive)\\n\\nlabeled\\n \\nOEMDRV\\n \\nis physically connected to the system. If the\\n \\nOEMDRV\\n \\nstorage device is present\\n\\nwhen the installation starts, it is treated as a driver update disk, and the installation program\\n\\nautomatically loads its drivers. Assisted\\n\\nThe installation program prompts you to locate a driver update. You can use any local storage device\\n\\nwith a label other than\\n \\nOEMDRV\\n. The\\n \\ninst.dd\\n \\nboot option is specified when starting the installation. If\\n\\nyou use this option without any parameters, the installation program displays all of the storage\\n\\ndevices connected to the system, and prompts you to select a device that contains a driver update.

In this scenario, the installation\\n\\nprogram attempts to load any available driver updates from the location and also\\n\\nprompts you to select a device that contains the driver update. Limitations\\n\\nOn UEFI systems with the Secure Boot technology enabled, all drivers must be signed with a valid\\n\\ncertificate.

The file name of your Kickstart configuration does not matter; however, it is recommended to use a\\n\\nsimple name as you will need to specify this name later in other configuration files or dialogs. Commands\\n\\nCommands are keywords that serve as directions for installation. Each command must be on a single\\n\\nline. Commands can take options. Specifying commands and options is similar to using Linux\\n\\ncommands in shell. Sections\\n\\nCertain special commands that begin with the percent\\n \\n%\\n \\ncharacter start a section. Interpretation of\\n\\ncommands in sections is different from commands placed outside sections. Every section must be\\n\\nfinished with\\n \\n%end\\n \\ncommand. Section types\\n\\nThe available sections are:\\n\\nAdd-on sections\\n. These sections use the\\n \\n%addon\\n \\naddon_name\\n \\ncommand. Package selection sections\\n. Starts with\\n \\n%packages\\n. Use it to list packages for installation,\\n\\nincluding indirect means such as package groups or modules. Script sections\\n. These start with\\n \\n%pre\\n,\\n \\n%pre-install\\n,\\n \\n%post\\n, and\\n \\n%onerror\\n. These sections\\n\\nare not required. Command section\\n\\nThe command section is a term used for the commands in the Kickstart file that are not part of any\\n\\nscript section or\\n \\n%packages\\n \\nsection. Script section count and ordering\\n\\nAll sections except the command section are optional and can be present multiple times. When a\\n\\nparticular type of script section is to be evaluated, all sections of that type present in the Kickstart\\n\\nare evaluated in order of appearance: two\\n \\n%post\\n \\nsections are evaluated one after another, in the\\n\\norder as they appear. However, you do not have to specify the various types of script sections in any\\n\\norder: it does not matter if there are\\n \\n%post\\n \\nsections before\\n \\n%pre\\n \\nsections. Comments\\n\\nKickstart comments are lines starting with the hash\\n \\n#\\n \\ncharacter.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"uffviSAQBW2NteTOe5BKrfQu1O2QNL5cJcs6Uop6Afw=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"db5a0f48-bfc3-449d-9150-4107d1690816":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"db5a0f48-bfc3-449d-9150-4107d1690816\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":61,\"total_pages\":136},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c1bc0478-e935-4863-89bd-0cba65c0cce2\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":61,\"total_pages\":136},\"hash\":\"rsHtrjiJpzHToi1oehmpHlVCa50QA8/oumjpM8Im/QE=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"296d8d44-c301-4861-af6c-27193f0e44b5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":61,\"total_pages\":136},\"hash\":\"uffviSAQBW2NteTOe5BKrfQu1O2QNL5cJcs6Uop6Afw=\"}},\"text\":\"Comments\\n\\nKickstart comments are lines starting with the hash\\n \\n#\\n \\ncharacter.

PACKAGE SELECTION IN KICKSTART\\n\\nKickstart uses sections started by the\\n \\n%packages\\n \\ncommand for selecting packages to install. You can\\n\\ninstall packages, groups, environments, module streams, and module profiles this way. A.2.1. Package selection section\\n\\nUse the\\n \\n%packages\\n \\ncommand to begin a Kickstart section which describes the software packages to be\\n\\ninstalled. The\\n \\n%packages\\n \\nsection must end with the\\n \\n%end\\n \\ncommand. You can specify packages by environment, group, module stream, module profile, or by their package\\n\\nnames. Several environments and groups that contain related packages are defined. See the\\n\\nrepository\\n/repodata/*-comps-\\nrepository\\n. architecture\\n.xml\\n \\nfile on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9\\n\\nInstallation DVD for a list of environments and groups. The\\n \\n*-comps-\\nrepository\\n. architecture\\n.xml\\n \\nfile contains a structure describing available environments\\n\\n(marked by the\\n \\n<environment>\\n \\ntag) and groups (the\\n \\n<group>\\n \\ntag). Each entry has an ID, user visibility\\n\\nvalue, name, description, and package list. If the group is selected for installation, the packages marked\\n\\nmandatory\\n \\nin the package list are always installed, the packages marked\\n \\ndefault\\n \\nare installed if they are\\n\\nnot specifically excluded elsewhere, and the packages marked\\n \\noptional\\n \\nmust be specifically included\\n\\nelsewhere even when the group is selected. You can specify a package group or environment using either its ID (the\\n \\n<id>\\n \\ntag) or name (the\\n \\n<name>\\n\\ntag). If you are not sure what package should be installed, Red Hat recommends you to select the\\n \\nMinimal\\n\\nInstall\\n \\nenvironment.

You can use this section to run tasks such as system subscription. You have the option of adding commands to run on the system once the installation is complete, but\\n\\nbefore the system is rebooted for the first time. This section must start with\\n \\n%post\\n \\nand end with\\n \\n%end\\n. The\\n \\n%post\\n \\nsection is useful for functions such as installing additional software or configuring an\\n\\nadditional name server. The post-install script is run in a\\n \\nchroot\\n \\nenvironment, therefore, performing\\n\\ntasks such as copying scripts or RPM packages from the installation media do not work by default. You\\n\\ncan change this behavior using the\\n \\n--nochroot\\n \\noption as described below. Then the\\n \\n%post\\n \\nscript will run\\n\\nin the installation environment, not in\\n \\nchroot\\n \\non the installed target system. Because post-install script runs in a\\n \\nchroot\\n \\nenvironment, most\\n \\nsystemctl\\n \\ncommands will refuse to\\n\\nperform any action.

KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS\\n\\nREFERENCE\\n\\nThis reference is a complete list of all Kickstart commands supported by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux\\n\\ninstallation program program. The commands are sorted alphabetically in a few broad categories. If a\\n\\ncommand can fall under multiple categories, it is listed in all of them. B.1. KICKSTART CHANGES\\n\\nThe following sections describe the changes in Kickstart commands and options in Red Hat\\n\\nEnterprise Linux 9. B.1.1. auth or authconfig is deprecated in RHEL 8\\n\\nThe\\n \\nauth\\n \\nor\\n \\nauthconfig\\n \\nKickstart command is deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because the\\n\\nauthconfig\\n \\ntool and package have been removed. Similarly to\\n \\nauthconfig\\n \\ncommands issued on command line,\\n \\nauthconfig\\n \\ncommands in Kickstart scripts\\n\\nnow use the\\n \\nauthselect-compat\\n \\ntool to run the new\\n \\nauthselect\\n \\ntool. For a description of this\\n\\ncompatibility layer and its known issues, see the manual page\\n \\nauthselect-migration(7)\\n. The installation\\n\\nprogram will automatically detect use of the deprecated commands and install on the system the\\n\\nauthselect-compat\\n \\npackage to provide the compatibility layer. B.1.2. Using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases\\n\\nIf you are using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases, see the\\n \\nRepositories\\n \\nsection of the\\n\\nConsiderations in adopting RHEL 8\\n \\ndocument for more information about the Red Hat Enterprise Linux\\n\\n8 BaseOS and AppStream repositories. B.1.3. Deprecated Kickstart commands and options\\n\\nThe following Kickstart commands and options have been deprecated in 9. timezone --ntpservers\\n \\n- use the\\n \\ntimesource\\n \\ncommand instead\\n\\ntimezone --nontp\\n\\nlogging --level\\n\\n%packages --excludeWeakdeps\\n \\n- use\\n \\n--exclude-weakdeps\\n \\ninstead\\n\\n%packages --instLangs\\n \\n- use\\n \\n--inst-langs\\n \\ninstead\\n\\n%anaconda\\n\\npwpolicy\\n \\n- use the Anaconda configuration files instead\\n\\nsyspurpose\\n \\n- use\\n \\nsubscription-manager syspurpose\\n \\ninstead\\n\\nWhere only specific options are listed, the base command and its other options are still available and not\\n\\ndeprecated.

Syntax\\n\\ncdrom\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nThis command has no options. To actually run the installation, you must specify one of\\n \\ncdrom\\n,\\n \\nharddrive\\n,\\n \\nhmc\\n,\\n \\nnfs\\n,\\n \\nliveimg\\n,\\n\\nostreesetup\\n,\\n \\nrhsm\\n, or\\n \\nurl\\n \\nunless the\\n \\ninst.repo\\n \\noption is specified on the kernel command line. B.2.2. cmdline\\n\\nThe\\n \\ncmdline\\n \\nKickstart command is optional. It performs the installation in a completely non-interactive\\n\\ncommand line mode. Any prompt for interaction halts the installation.

If no mode is\\n\\nspecified, the system will use graphical mode if possible, or prompt you to choose from VNC\\n\\nand text mode. This command has no options. This mode is useful on 64-bit IBM Z systems with the x3270 terminal. B.2.3. driverdisk\\n\\nThe\\n \\ndriverdisk\\n \\nKickstart command is optional. Use it to provide additional drivers to the installation\\n\\nprogram. Driver disks can be used during Kickstart installations to provide additional drivers not included by\\n\\ndefault. You must copy the driver disks contents to the root directory of a partition on the system’s disk. Then, you must use the\\n \\ndriverdisk\\n \\ncommand to specify that the installation program should look for a\\n\\ndriver disk and its location.

KICKSTART COMMANDS FOR ADDONS SUPPLIED WITH THE\\n\\nRHEL INSTALLATION PROGRAM\\n\\nThe Kickstart commands in this section are related to add-ons supplied by default with the Red Hat\\n\\nEnterprise Linux installation program: Kdump and OpenSCAP. B.6.1. %addon com_redhat_kdump\\n\\nThe\\n \\n%addon com_redhat_kdump\\n \\nKickstart command is optional. This command configures the kdump\\n\\nkernel crash dumping mechanism. Syntax\\n\\n%addon com_redhat_kdump [\\nOPTIONS\\n]\\n\\n%end\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nThe syntax for this command is unusual because it is an add-on rather than a built-in\\n\\nKickstart command. Notes\\n\\nKdump is a kernel crash dumping mechanism that allows you to save the contents of the system’s\\n\\nmemory for later analysis. It relies on\\n \\nkexec\\n, which can be used to boot a Linux kernel from the context\\n\\nof another kernel without rebooting the system, and preserve the contents of the first kernel’s memory\\n\\nthat would otherwise be lost. In case of a system crash,\\n \\nkexec\\n \\nboots into a second kernel (a capture kernel). This capture kernel\\n\\nresides in a reserved part of the system memory. Kdump then captures the contents of the crashed\\n\\nkernel’s memory (a crash dump) and saves it to a specified location. The location cannot be configured\\n\\nusing this Kickstart command; it must be configured after the installation by editing the\\n\\n/etc/kdump.conf\\n \\nconfiguration file.

B.8. KICKSTART COMMANDS FOR SYSTEM RECOVERY\\n\\nThe Kickstart command in this section repairs an installed system. B.8.1. rescue\\n\\nThe\\n \\nrescue\\n \\nKickstart command is optional. It provides a shell environment with root privileges and a set\\n\\nof system management tools to repair the installation and to troubleshoot the issues like:\\n\\nMount file systems as read-only\\n\\nBlocklist or add a driver provided on a driver disc\\n\\nInstall or upgrade system packages\\n\\nManage partitions\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nThe Kickstart rescue mode is different from the rescue mode and emergency mode,\\n\\nwhich are provided as part of the systemd and service manager. The\\n \\nrescue\\n \\ncommand does not modify the system on its own. It only sets up the rescue environment by\\n\\nmounting the system under /mnt/sysimage in a read-write mode. You can choose not to mount the\\n\\nsystem, or to mount it in read-only mode. Syntax\\n\\nrescue [--nomount|--romount]\\n\\nOptions\\n\\n--nomount\\n \\nor\\n \\n--romount\\n \\n- Controls how the installed system is mounted in the rescue\\n\\nenvironment. By default, the installation program finds your system and mount it in read-write\\n\\nmode, telling you where it has performed this mount. You can optionally select to not mount\\n\\nanything (the\\n \\n--nomount\\n \\noption) or mount in read-only mode (the\\n \\n--romount\\n \\noption). Only one\\n\\nof these two options can be used. Notes\\n\\nTo run a rescue mode, make a copy of the Kickstart file, and include the\\n \\nrescue\\n \\ncommand in it. Using the\\n \\nrescue\\n \\ncommand causes the installer to perform the following steps:\\n\\n1\\n. Run the\\n \\n%pre\\n \\nscript. 2\\n. Set up environment for rescue mode.
