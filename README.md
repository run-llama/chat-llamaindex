Welcome to [Unc](https://unc.de). A robust, scalable open-source platform built specifically for implementing privacy-first, enterprise-level ChatGPT.

Getting started with Unc is a breeze. Visit [unc.de](https://unc.de) - a hosted version of Unc with no user authentication, provides an immediate start.

## 🚀 Features

Unc is enterprise-ready, featuring:

- Self-hosted, can be installed in own cloud (private or public).
- Chat with your own HTML and PDF documents.
- Create bots using prompt engineering (no-code) and share them with other users. This avoids the repetition of frequently used prompts.
- Supports [Azure OpenAI from Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), eliminating traffic to OpenAI.
- Privacy first; personal data is stored locally in the browser.

## 💼 Enterprise

A typical enterprise installation requires:

- Custom user authentication (e.g. Active Directory).
- Installation in a corporate cloud (AWS or Azure).
- Integration with data from third-party systems (e.g., Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, Oracle).
