SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux supports the following architectures:\n\nAMD and Intel 64-bit architectures\n\nThe 64-bit ARM architecture\n\nIBM Power Systems, Little Endian\n\n64-bit IBM Z architectures\n\nNOTE\n\nFor installation instructions on IBM Power Servers, see\n \nIBM installation documentation\n. To\n\nensure that your system is supported for installing RHEL, see\n \nhttps://catalog.redhat.com\n\nand\n \nhttps://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits\n. 1.2. INSTALLATION TERMINOLOGY\n\nThis section describes Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation terminology. Different terminology can be\n\nused for the same concepts, depending on its upstream or downstream origin. Anaconda\n: The operating system installer used in Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and their\n\nderivatives. Anaconda is a set of Python modules and scripts with additional files like Gtk widgets\n\n(written in C), systemd units, and dracut libraries. Together, they form a tool that allows users to set\n\nparameters of the resulting (target) system. In this document, the term\n \ninstallation program\n \nrefers to\n\nthe installation aspect of\n \nAnaconda\n.

INSTALLATION METHODS\n\nDepending on your requirements, you can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux using several methods. Review the following sections to determine the best installation method for your requirements. 2.1. AVAILABLE INSTALLATION METHODS\n\nYou can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux using any of the following methods:\n\nGUI-based installations\n\nSystem or cloud image-based installations\n\nAdvanced installations\n\nGUI-based installations\n\nYou can choose from the following GUI-based installation methods:\n\nInstall RHEL using an ISO image from the Customer Portal:\nInstall Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n\nby downloading the\n \nDVD ISO\n \nimage file from the Customer Portal. Registration is performed\n\nafter the installation completes. This installation method is supported by the GUI and Kickstart. Register and install RHEL from the Content Delivery Network:\nRegister your system, attach\n\nsubscriptions, and install Red Hat Enterprise Linux from the Content Delivery Network (CDN). This installation method supports\n \nBoot ISO\n \nand\n \nDVD ISO\n \nimage files; however, the\n \nBoot ISO\n\nimage file is recommended as the installation source defaults to CDN for the Boot ISO image\n\nfile. After registering the system, the installer downloads and installs packages from the CDN. This installation method is also supported by Kickstart. Perform a remote RHEL installation using VNC:\n \nThe RHEL installation program offers two\n\nVirtual Network Computing (VNC) installation modes: Direct and Connect. After a connection is\n\nestablished, the two modes do not differ. The mode you select depends on your environment. Install RHEL from the network using PXE :\nWith a network installation using preboot execution\n\nenvironment (PXE), you can install Red Hat Enterprise Linux to a system that has access to an\n\ninstallation server. At a minimum, two systems are required for a network installation. System or cloud image-based installations\n\nYou can use system or cloud image-based installation methods only in virtual and cloud environments. To perform a system or cloud image-based installation, use Red Hat Image Builder. Image builder\n\ncreates customized system images of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including the system images for cloud\n\ndeployment. For more information about installing RHEL using Image builder, see\n \nComposing a customized RHEL\n\nsystem image\n.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"eqBlvvaV3Nyk7wAMhyH+HSzSgf8xkPEtVMvME2sfNd0="},"53776a79-e7e8-4cea-a65e-3554d7a9ab89":{"id_":"53776a79-e7e8-4cea-a65e-3554d7a9ab89","metadata":{"page_number":12,"total_pages":136},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a031eafc-c429-42ec-a987-210bdb1e9e9a","metadata":{"page_number":12,"total_pages":136},"hash":"mr0lQIuYaqV+0LC/vVhnqwgWAb/u9MG0/T3uGMrV6us="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cb37413b-e514-4194-b721-7cd28c6ab389","metadata":{"page_number":12,"total_pages":136},"hash":"eqBlvvaV3Nyk7wAMhyH+HSzSgf8xkPEtVMvME2sfNd0="}},"text":"Advanced installations\n\nYou can choose from the following advanced installation methods:\n\nPerform an automated RHEL installation using Kickstart:\n \nKickstart is an automated process\n\nthat helps you install the operating system by specifying all your requirements and\n\nconfigurations in a file.

KICKSTART INSTALLATION BASICS\n\nThe following provides basic information about Kickstart and how to use it to automate installing\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux. 3.1. WHAT ARE KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS\n\nKickstart provides a way to automate the RHEL installation process, either partially or fully. Kickstart files contain some or all of the RHEL installation options. For example, the time zone, how the\n\ndrives should be partitioned, or which packages should be installed. Providing a prepared Kickstart file\n\nallows an installation without the need for any user intervention. This is especially useful when deploying\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux on a large number of systems at once. Kickstart files also provide more options regarding software selection. When installing Red Hat\n\nEnterprise Linux manually using the graphical installation interface, the software selection is limited to\n\npre-defined environments and add-ons. A Kickstart file allows you to install or remove individual\n\npackages as well. Kickstart files can be kept on a single server system and read by individual computers during the\n\ninstallation. This installation method supports the use of a single Kickstart file to install Red Hat\n\nEnterprise Linux on multiple machines, making it ideal for network and system administrators. All Kickstart scripts and log files of their execution are stored in the\n \n/tmp\n \ndirectory of the newly installed\n\nsystem to assist with debugging installation issues. The kickstart used for installation as well as the\n\nAnaconda generated output kickstart are stored in\n \n/root\n \non the target system and that logs from\n\nkickstart scriptlet execution are stored in\n \n/var/log/anaconda\n. NOTE\n\nIn previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Kickstart could be used for upgrading\n\nsystems. Starting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, this functionality has been removed\n\nand system upgrades are instead handled by specialized tools. For details on upgrading to\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9, see\n \nUpgrading from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9\n \nand\n \nConsiderations in\n\nadopting RHEL\n. 3.2. AUTOMATED INSTALLATION WORKFLOW\n\nKickstart installations can be performed using a local DVD, a local disk, or a NFS, FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS\n\nserver.

CREATING A KICKSTART FILE WITH THE KICKSTART\n\nCONFIGURATION TOOL\n\nUsers with a Red Hat Customer Portal account can use the Kickstart Generator tool in the Customer\n\nPortal Labs to generate Kickstart files online. This tool will walk you through the basic configuration and\n\nenables you to download the resulting Kickstart file. Prerequisites\n\nYou have a Red Hat Customer Portal account and an active Red Hat subscription. Procedure\n\n1\n. Open the Kickstart generator lab information page at\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/labsinfo/kickstartconfig\n. 2\n. Click the\n \nGo to Application\n \nbutton to the left of heading and wait for the next page to load. 3\n. Select\n \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9\n \nin the drop-down menu and wait for the page to update. 4\n. Describe the system to be installed using the fields in the form. You can use the links on the left side of the form to quickly navigate between sections of the\n\nform. 5\n. To download the generated Kickstart file, click the red\n \nDownload\n \nbutton at the top of the page. Your web browser saves the file. 4.2. CREATING A KICKSTART FILE BY PERFORMING A MANUAL\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nThe recommended approach to creating Kickstart files is to use the file created by a manual installation\n\nof Red Hat Enterprise Linux. After an installation completes, all choices made during the installation are\n\nsaved into a Kickstart file named\n \nanaconda-ks.cfg\n, located in the\n \n/root/\n \ndirectory on the installed\n\nsystem. You can use this file to reproduce the installation in the same way as before.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"bTnEw9TC9dgDSxZtX7+3qAePc6vZ9KBzxGCetREkbf8="},"03d9aaf7-0ae3-472d-83b4-3e140a3c1659":{"id_":"03d9aaf7-0ae3-472d-83b4-3e140a3c1659","metadata":{"page_number":17,"total_pages":136},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"b5d70c32-57ed-4276-a332-21ac86a41a85","metadata":{"page_number":17,"total_pages":136},"hash":"vzIqFpvq4/ccgbd0owPFuxNw6cgk8VIefmWngk8esQ4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"653036d9-b8cb-4f07-a02e-8014d233dee5","metadata":{"page_number":17,"total_pages":136},"hash":"bTnEw9TC9dgDSxZtX7+3qAePc6vZ9KBzxGCetREkbf8="}},"text":"You can use this file to reproduce the installation in the same way as before.

CREATING INSTALLATION SOURCES FOR\n\nKICKSTART INSTALLATIONS\n\nThis section describes how to create an installation source for the Boot ISO image using the DVD ISO\n\nimage that contains the required repositories and software packages. 6.1. TYPES OF INSTALLATION SOURCE\n\nYou can use one of the following installation sources for minimal boot images:\n\nDVD:\n \nBurn the DVD ISO image to a DVD. The DVD will be automatically used as the installation\n\nsource (software package source). Disk or USB drive:\n \nCopy the DVD ISO image to the disk and configure the installation program\n\nto install the software packages from the drive. If you use a USB drive, verify that it is connected\n\nto the system before the installation begins. The installation program cannot detect media\n\nafter the installation begins. Disk limitation\n: The DVD ISO image on the disk must be on a partition with a file system\n\nthat the installation program can mount. The supported file systems are\n \nxfs\n,\n \next2\n,\n \next3\n,\n\next4\n, and\n \nvfat (FAT32)\n. WARNING\n\nOn Microsoft Windows systems, the default file system used when\n\nformatting disks is NTFS. The exFAT file system is also available. However,\n\nneither of these file systems can be mounted during the installation. If you\n\nare creating a disk or a USB drive as an installation source on Microsoft\n\nWindows, verify that you formatted the drive as FAT32. Note that the\n\nFAT32 file system cannot store files larger than 4 GiB. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, you can enable installation from a directory\n\non a local disk. To do so, you need to copy the contents of the DVD ISO\n\nimage to a directory on a disk and then specify the directory as the\n\ninstallation source instead of the ISO image. For example:\n \ninst.repo=hd:\n\n<device>:<path to the directory>\n\nNetwork location:\n \nCopy the DVD ISO image or the installation tree (extracted contents of the\n\nDVD ISO image) to a network location and perform the installation over the network using the\n\nfollowing protocols:\n\nNFS:\n \nThe DVD ISO image is in a Network File System (NFS) share. HTTPS, HTTP or FTP:\n \nThe installation tree is on a network location that is accessible over\n\nHTTP, HTTPS or FTP. 6.2.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5WYzPQU1QWFI4c9FBWdrEMHcvmbZlU1mSZTRp0Rize0="},"64c0e2a5-5617-47bd-8a81-d0b0029ffd0f":{"id_":"64c0e2a5-5617-47bd-8a81-d0b0029ffd0f","metadata":{"page_number":26,"total_pages":136},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"1f99c713-c3b6-4b1a-ad88-4dd4253bbcb4","metadata":{"page_number":26,"total_pages":136},"hash":"vzsF3anrKNADVEO+2HJlmIns3m9rTEqPQjjO3iRbdbg="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"12921d13-686b-4eca-a458-f749939c975d","metadata":{"page_number":26,"total_pages":136},"hash":"5WYzPQU1QWFI4c9FBWdrEMHcvmbZlU1mSZTRp0Rize0="}},"text":"6.2.

STARTING KICKSTART INSTALLATIONS\n\nYou can start Kickstart installations in multiple ways:\n\nManually by entering the installation program boot menu and specifying the options including\n\nKickstart file there. Automatically by editing the boot options in PXE boot. Automatically by providing the file on a volume with specific name. Learn how to perform each of these methods in the following sections. 8.1. STARTING A KICKSTART INSTALLATION MANUALLY\n\nThis section explains how to start a Kickstart installation manually, which means some user interaction is\n\nrequired (adding boot options at the\n \nboot:\n \nprompt). Use the boot option\n \ninst.ks=\nlocation\n \nwhen booting\n\nthe installation system, replacing location with the location of your Kickstart file. The exact way to\n\nspecify the boot option and the form of boot prompt depends on your system’s architecture. For\n\ndetailed information, see the\n \nBoot options for RHEL installer\n \nguide. Prerequisites\n\nYou have a Kickstart file ready in a location accessible from the system to be installed. Procedure\n\n1\n. Boot the system using a local media (a CD, DVD, or a USB flash drive). 2\n. At the boot prompt, specify the required boot options. a\n. If the Kickstart file or a required repository is in a network location, you may need to\n\nconfigure the network using the\n \nip=\n \noption. The installer tries to configure all network\n\ndevices using the DHCP protocol by default without this option. b\n. Add the\n \ninst.ks=\n \nboot option and the location of the Kickstart file. c\n. In order to access a software source from which necessary packages will be installed, you\n\nmay need to add the\n \ninst.repo=\n \noption. If you do not specify this option, you must specify\n\nthe installation source in the Kickstart file. 3\n. Start the installation by confirming your added boot options. The installation begins now, using the options specified in the Kickstart file. If the Kickstart file is\n\nvalid and contains all required commands, the installation is completely automated from this\n\npoint forward.

REGISTERING AND INSTALLING RHEL FROM\n\nSATELLITE USING KICKSTART\n\nThis section contains information about how to register your system, attach RHEL subscriptions, and\n\ninstall from the Red Hat Satellite using Kickstart. 12.1. REGISTERING AND INSTALLING RHEL FROM SATELLITE\n\nThis procedure describes how to register your system, attach RHEL subscriptions, and install from a\n\nSatellite instance using the\n \nrhsm\n \nKickstart command. It also shows how to configure system purpose\n\nand connect the system to Red Hat Insights. The\n \nrhsm\n \nKickstart command removes the requirement of\n\nusing custom\n \n%post\n \nscripts when registering the system. IMPORTANT\n\nSatellite installation is supported by the Boot ISO and DVD ISO image files. However, it is recommended that you use the Boot ISO image file as the\n\ninstallation source defaults to Satellite for the Boot ISO image file. The installation source repository used after system registration is dependent on\n\nhow the system was booted. For more information, see the\n \nInstallation source\n\nrepository after the system registration\n. Repository configuration is not required in a Kickstart file as your subscription\n\ngoverns which satellite hosted repositories the system can access. Prerequisites\n\nYour system is connected to a network that can access the Satellite instance. The Red Hat Satellite Server version is 6.11 or later\n\nYou have created a Kickstart file and made it available to the installation program on removable\n\nmedia, a disk, or a network location using an HTTP(S), FTP, or NFS server. The Kickstart file is in a location that is accessible by the system that is to be installed. You have an organization ID, activation key, and the URL of the Satellite 6.11 instance you want\n\nto use. You have enabled, synced, and added the required BaseOS and AppStream RPMs repositories\n\nto the content-view. The activation key has the release version set to 9.x, and the concerned content-view is\n\nselected in it. Procedure\n\n1\n. Open the Kickstart file. 2\n. Edit the file to add the\n \nrhsm\n \nKickstart command and its options to the file:\n\nOrganization (required)\n\nEnter the organization id.

UPDATING DRIVERS DURING INSTALLATION\n\nThis section describes how to complete a driver update during the Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation\n\nprocess. NOTE\n\nThis is an optional step of the installation process. Red Hat recommends that you do not\n\nperform a driver update unless it is necessary. Prerequisites\n\nYou have been notified by Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third-party vendor that a\n\ndriver update is required during Red Hat Enterprise Linux installation. 14.1. OVERVIEW\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux supports drivers for many hardware devices but some newly-released drivers\n\nmay not be supported. A driver update should only be performed if an unsupported driver prevents the\n\ninstallation from completing. Updating drivers during installation is typically only required to support a\n\nparticular configuration. For example, installing drivers for a storage adapter card that provides access\n\nto your system’s storage devices. WARNING\n\nDriver update disks may disable conflicting kernel drivers. In rare cases, unloading a\n\nkernel module may cause installation errors. 14.2. TYPES OF DRIVER UPDATE\n\nRed Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third party provides the driver update as an ISO image file. Once you receive the ISO image file, choose the type of driver update. Types of driver update\n\nAutomatic\n\nThe recommended driver update method; a storage device (including a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive)\n\nlabeled\n \nOEMDRV\n \nis physically connected to the system. If the\n \nOEMDRV\n \nstorage device is present\n\nwhen the installation starts, it is treated as a driver update disk, and the installation program\n\nautomatically loads its drivers. Assisted\n\nThe installation program prompts you to locate a driver update. You can use any local storage device\n\nwith a label other than\n \nOEMDRV\n. The\n \ninst.dd\n \nboot option is specified when starting the installation. If\n\nyou use this option without any parameters, the installation program displays all of the storage\n\ndevices connected to the system, and prompts you to select a device that contains a driver update. Manual\n\nManually specify a path to a driver update image or an RPM package. You can use any local storage\n\n\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Performing an advanced RHEL 9 installation\n\n50","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4BeFk27b61u4nBUt48dOmT93mdThBP74dutgg8LSevM="},"25b1f517-5773-4025-acb4-f3ba99dd428b":{"id_":"25b1f517-5773-4025-acb4-f3ba99dd428b","metadata":{"page_number":54,"total_pages":136},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2e2564e1-b55f-41f7-80a5-1cb2d9e9a571","metadata":{"page_number":54,"total_pages":136},"hash":"TVYFKKkNAWjR76PO2p4k1apoyCCMtHE5MLg9qFH9llg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8603b15a-bc6f-4bba-ba56-5ef9cf227d00","metadata":{"page_number":54,"total_pages":136},"hash":"mmUIGm0iBRieB647EiqgbDr3bK/KbyX/ZgQ0aVHnwtM="}},"text":"device with a label other than\n \nOEMDRV\n, or a network location accessible from the installation\n\nsystem. The\n \ninst.dd=location\n \nboot option is specified when starting the installation, where\n \nlocation\n \nis\n\nthe path to a driver update disk or ISO image. When you specify this option, the installation program\n\nattempts to load any driver updates found at the specified location. With manual driver updates, you\n\ncan specify local storage devices, or a network location (HTTP, HTTPS or FTP server). NOTE\n\nYou can use both\n \ninst.dd=location\n \nand\n \ninst.dd\n \nsimultaneously, where\n \nlocation\n \nis\n\nthe path to a driver update disk or ISO image. In this scenario, the installation\n\nprogram attempts to load any available driver updates from the location and also\n\nprompts you to select a device that contains the driver update. Limitations\n\nOn UEFI systems with the Secure Boot technology enabled, all drivers must be signed with a valid\n\ncertificate. Red Hat drivers are signed by one of Red Hat’s private keys and authenticated by its\n\ncorresponding public key in the kernel. If you load additional, separate drivers, verify that they are\n\nsigned. 14.3. PREPARING A DRIVER UPDATE\n\nThis procedure describes how to prepare a driver update on a CD and DVD. Prerequisites\n\nYou have received the driver update ISO image from Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a\n\ntrusted third-party vendor. You have burned the driver update ISO image to a CD or DVD. WARNING\n\nIf only a single ISO image file ending in\n \n.iso\n \nis available on the CD or DVD, the burn\n\nprocess has not been successful.

BOOTING A BETA SYSTEM WITH UEFI SECURE\n\nBOOT\n\nTo enhance the security of your operating system, use the UEFI Secure Boot feature for signature\n\nverification when booting a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta release on systems having UEFI Secure Boot\n\nenabled. 15.1. UEFI SECURE BOOT AND RHEL BETA RELEASES\n\nUEFI Secure Boot requires that the operating system kernel is signed with a recognized private key. UEFI Secure Boot then verifies the signature using the corresponding public key. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta releases, the kernel is signed with a Red Hat Beta-specific private\n\nkey. UEFI Secure Boot attempts to verify the signature using the corresponding public key, but because\n\nthe hardware does not recognize the Beta private key, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Beta release system\n\nfails to boot. Therefore, to use UEFI Secure Boot with a Beta release, add the Red Hat Beta public key\n\nto your system using the Machine Owner Key (MOK) facility. 15.2.

KICKSTART SCRIPT FILE FORMAT REFERENCE\n\nThis reference describes in detail the kickstart file format. A.1. KICKSTART FILE FORMAT\n\nKickstart scripts are plain text files that contain keywords recognized by the installation program, which\n\nserve as directions for the installation. Any text editor able to save files as ASCII text, such as\n \nGedit\n \nor\n\nvim\n \non Linux systems or\n \nNotepad\n \non Windows systems, can be used to create and edit Kickstart files. The file name of your Kickstart configuration does not matter; however, it is recommended to use a\n\nsimple name as you will need to specify this name later in other configuration files or dialogs. Commands\n\nCommands are keywords that serve as directions for installation. Each command must be on a single\n\nline. Commands can take options. Specifying commands and options is similar to using Linux\n\ncommands in shell. Sections\n\nCertain special commands that begin with the percent\n \n%\n \ncharacter start a section. Interpretation of\n\ncommands in sections is different from commands placed outside sections. Every section must be\n\nfinished with\n \n%end\n \ncommand. Section types\n\nThe available sections are:\n\nAdd-on sections\n. These sections use the\n \n%addon\n \naddon_name\n \ncommand. Package selection sections\n. Starts with\n \n%packages\n. Use it to list packages for installation,\n\nincluding indirect means such as package groups or modules. Script sections\n. These start with\n \n%pre\n,\n \n%pre-install\n,\n \n%post\n, and\n \n%onerror\n. These sections\n\nare not required. Command section\n\nThe command section is a term used for the commands in the Kickstart file that are not part of any\n\nscript section or\n \n%packages\n \nsection. Script section count and ordering\n\nAll sections except the command section are optional and can be present multiple times. When a\n\nparticular type of script section is to be evaluated, all sections of that type present in the Kickstart\n\nare evaluated in order of appearance: two\n \n%post\n \nsections are evaluated one after another, in the\n\norder as they appear. However, you do not have to specify the various types of script sections in any\n\norder: it does not matter if there are\n \n%post\n \nsections before\n \n%pre\n \nsections.

A.5. KICKSTART ADD-ON SECTIONS\n\nStarting with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Kickstart installations support add-ons. These add-ons can\n\nexpand the basic Kickstart (and Anaconda) functionality in many ways. To use an add-on in your Kickstart file, use the\n \n%addon\n \naddon_name\n \noptions\n \ncommand, and finish the\n\ncommand with an\n \n%end\n \nstatement, similar to pre-installation and post-installation script sections. For\n\nexample, if you want to use the Kdump add-on, which is distributed with Anaconda by default, use the\n\nfollowing commands:\n\n%addon com_redhat_kdump --enable --reserve-mb=auto\n\n%end\n\nThe\n \n%addon\n \ncommand does not include any options of its own - all options are dependent on the actual\n\nadd-on.

KICKSTART COMMANDS AND OPTIONS\n\nREFERENCE\n\nThis reference is a complete list of all Kickstart commands supported by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n\ninstallation program program. The commands are sorted alphabetically in a few broad categories. If a\n\ncommand can fall under multiple categories, it is listed in all of them. B.1. KICKSTART CHANGES\n\nThe following sections describe the changes in Kickstart commands and options in Red Hat\n\nEnterprise Linux 9. B.1.1. auth or authconfig is deprecated in RHEL 8\n\nThe\n \nauth\n \nor\n \nauthconfig\n \nKickstart command is deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 because the\n\nauthconfig\n \ntool and package have been removed. Similarly to\n \nauthconfig\n \ncommands issued on command line,\n \nauthconfig\n \ncommands in Kickstart scripts\n\nnow use the\n \nauthselect-compat\n \ntool to run the new\n \nauthselect\n \ntool. For a description of this\n\ncompatibility layer and its known issues, see the manual page\n \nauthselect-migration(7)\n. The installation\n\nprogram will automatically detect use of the deprecated commands and install on the system the\n\nauthselect-compat\n \npackage to provide the compatibility layer. B.1.2. Using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases\n\nIf you are using Kickstart files from previous RHEL releases, see the\n \nRepositories\n \nsection of the\n\nConsiderations in adopting RHEL 8\n \ndocument for more information about the Red Hat Enterprise Linux\n\n8 BaseOS and AppStream repositories. B.1.3. Deprecated Kickstart commands and options\n\nThe following Kickstart commands and options have been deprecated in 9. timezone --ntpservers\n \n- use the\n \ntimesource\n \ncommand instead\n\ntimezone --nontp\n\nlogging --level\n\n%packages --excludeWeakdeps\n \n- use\n \n--exclude-weakdeps\n \ninstead\n\n%packages --instLangs\n \n- use\n \n--inst-langs\n \ninstead\n\n%anaconda\n\npwpolicy\n \n- use the Anaconda configuration files instead\n\nsyspurpose\n \n- use\n \nsubscription-manager syspurpose\n \ninstead\n\nWhere only specific options are listed, the base command and its other options are still available and not\n\ndeprecated. Using the deprecated commands in Kickstart files prints a warning in the logs. You can turn\n\nthe deprecated command warnings into errors with the\n \ninst.ksstrict\n \nboot option.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TpJhTUj3chIQ709VOnrFo9AHwmdj9tDeN7sj5YLjJUg="},"a400747e-aa4f-414b-85a1-1cba98c23571":{"id_":"a400747e-aa4f-414b-85a1-1cba98c23571","metadata":{"page_number":72,"total_pages":136},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"a9272f72-e3d0-43f3-8f19-4b8c2526c08c","metadata":{"page_number":72,"total_pages":136},"hash":"Meh8d3EEznM1I+1PjmX8jRGIh0XS0Vh8ctmA31tj6hM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3c771c72-c23c-4350-a87b-d19e90c8184c","metadata":{"page_number":72,"total_pages":136},"hash":"TpJhTUj3chIQ709VOnrFo9AHwmdj9tDeN7sj5YLjJUg="}},"text":"B.1.4.

If no mode is\n\nspecified, the system will use graphical mode if possible, or prompt you to choose from VNC\n\nand text mode. This command has no options. This mode is useful on 64-bit IBM Z systems with the x3270 terminal. B.2.3. driverdisk\n\nThe\n \ndriverdisk\n \nKickstart command is optional. Use it to provide additional drivers to the installation\n\nprogram. Driver disks can be used during Kickstart installations to provide additional drivers not included by\n\ndefault. You must copy the driver disks contents to the root directory of a partition on the system’s disk. Then, you must use the\n \ndriverdisk\n \ncommand to specify that the installation program should look for a\n\ndriver disk and its location. Syntax\n\ndriverdisk [\npartition\n|--source=\nurl\n|--biospart=\nbiospart\n]\n\nOptions\n\nYou must specify the location of driver disk in one way out of these:\n\npartition\n \n- Partition containing the driver disk.

Use this option to accept the End User License Agreement\n\n(EULA) without user interaction. Specifying this option prevents Initial Setup from prompting you to\n\naccept the license agreement after you finish the installation and reboot the system for the first time. Syntax\n\neula [--agreed]\n\nOptions\n\n--agreed\n \n(required) - Accept the EULA. This option must always be used, otherwise the\n \neula\n\ncommand is meaningless. B.2.5. firstboot\n\nThe\n \nfirstboot\n \nKickstart command is optional. It determines whether the\n \nInitial Setup\n \napplication starts\n\nthe first time the system is booted. If enabled, the\n \ninitial-setup\n \npackage must be installed. If not\n\nspecified, this option is disabled by default.

For a description of the compatibility\n\nlayer and its known issues, see the manual page\n \nauthselect-migration(7)\n. The installation\n\nprogram will automatically detect use of the deprecated commands and install on the system\n\nthe\n \nauthselect-compat\n \npackage to provide the compatibility layer.

KICKSTART COMMANDS FOR ADDONS SUPPLIED WITH THE\n\nRHEL INSTALLATION PROGRAM\n\nThe Kickstart commands in this section are related to add-ons supplied by default with the Red Hat\n\nEnterprise Linux installation program: Kdump and OpenSCAP. B.6.1. %addon com_redhat_kdump\n\nThe\n \n%addon com_redhat_kdump\n \nKickstart command is optional. This command configures the kdump\n\nkernel crash dumping mechanism. Syntax\n\n%addon com_redhat_kdump [\nOPTIONS\n]\n\n%end\n\nNOTE\n\nThe syntax for this command is unusual because it is an add-on rather than a built-in\n\nKickstart command. Notes\n\nKdump is a kernel crash dumping mechanism that allows you to save the contents of the system’s\n\nmemory for later analysis. It relies on\n \nkexec\n, which can be used to boot a Linux kernel from the context\n\nof another kernel without rebooting the system, and preserve the contents of the first kernel’s memory\n\nthat would otherwise be lost. In case of a system crash,\n \nkexec\n \nboots into a second kernel (a capture kernel). This capture kernel\n\nresides in a reserved part of the system memory. Kdump then captures the contents of the crashed\n\nkernel’s memory (a crash dump) and saves it to a specified location. The location cannot be configured\n\nusing this Kickstart command; it must be configured after the installation by editing the\n\n/etc/kdump.conf\n \nconfiguration file. For more information about Kdump, see the\n \nInstalling kdump\n \n.

B.8. KICKSTART COMMANDS FOR SYSTEM RECOVERY\n\nThe Kickstart command in this section repairs an installed system. B.8.1. rescue\n\nThe\n \nrescue\n \nKickstart command is optional. It provides a shell environment with root privileges and a set\n\nof system management tools to repair the installation and to troubleshoot the issues like:\n\nMount file systems as read-only\n\nBlocklist or add a driver provided on a driver disc\n\nInstall or upgrade system packages\n\nManage partitions\n\nNOTE\n\nThe Kickstart rescue mode is different from the rescue mode and emergency mode,\n\nwhich are provided as part of the systemd and service manager. The\n \nrescue\n \ncommand does not modify the system on its own. It only sets up the rescue environment by\n\nmounting the system under /mnt/sysimage in a read-write mode. You can choose not to mount the\n\nsystem, or to mount it in read-only mode. Syntax\n\nrescue [--nomount|--romount]\n\nOptions\n\n--nomount\n \nor\n \n--romount\n \n- Controls how the installed system is mounted in the rescue\n\nenvironment. By default, the installation program finds your system and mount it in read-write\n\nmode, telling you where it has performed this mount. You can optionally select to not mount\n\nanything (the\n \n--nomount\n \noption) or mount in read-only mode (the\n \n--romount\n \noption). Only one\n\nof these two options can be used. Notes\n\nTo run a rescue mode, make a copy of the Kickstart file, and include the\n \nrescue\n \ncommand in it. Using the\n \nrescue\n \ncommand causes the installer to perform the following steps:\n\n1\n. Run the\n \n%pre\n \nscript. 2\n. Set up environment for rescue mode.

In addition, the sensors work only when you wear your\n\nApple Watch on the top of your wrist.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"1OKdlcknMFGLR3L0gUcD84TGK6U1VEnmhmBTUn2OrQw="},"166805ef-735b-4e05-b64a-856f76084a44":{"id_":"166805ef-735b-4e05-b64a-856f76084a44","metadata":{"page_number":48,"total_pages":394},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"984c8377-ceeb-4acf-bb4d-766256956d39","metadata":{"page_number":48,"total_pages":394},"hash":"c3t4Ym80KCgfy+lAvwp4GwRN9pfYEhSbzPuNWHNf3tk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8845a2db-0b26-4db5-a859-f2e38beccf5c","metadata":{"page_number":48,"total_pages":394},"hash":"1OKdlcknMFGLR3L0gUcD84TGK6U1VEnmhmBTUn2OrQw="}},"text":"For more information, see the Apple Support articles\n \nWearing your Apple Watch\n \nand\n\nChange your Apple Watch band\n.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"5jOjt/zgh9PP9O4XYmJuOriumiz36qZixJFureE/kPs="},"8527e09e-d2ec-4afe-b024-b293f7190c5f":{"id_":"8527e09e-d2ec-4afe-b024-b293f7190c5f","metadata":{"page_number":49,"total_pages":394},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"adf608a1-a45a-443c-a73b-5a8445dc5dec","metadata":{"page_number":49,"total_pages":394},"hash":"GYzu2V4sK7o4MJRtmN7g+8sSFYZWfb8NVrcyUJUM3j0="}},"text":"49\nApple Watch User Guide\n\nSet up Apple Watch for a family member\n\nSet up a family member’s Apple Watch\n\nYou can set up and manage Apple Watch for someone who doesn’t have their own iPhone—\n\nyour school-aged child or parent, for example.

See\n \nRemove, change, and\n\nfasten Apple Watch bands\n. •\n \nWipe Apple Watch clean with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth. If necessary, you can also\n\nlightly dampen the cloth with fresh water. •\n \nDry Apple Watch with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth. To help avoid damaging Apple Watch, observe the following:\n\n•\n \nDon’t clean Apple Watch while it’s charging. •\n \nDon’t dry Apple Watch or the bands using any external heat source (for example,\n\na hair dryer). •\n \nDon’t use cleaning products, ultrasonic cleaners, or compressed air when cleaning your\n\nApple Watch. •\n \nDon’t insert objects into any opening or port on Apple Watch. The front of Apple Watch is made of Ion-X glass (strengthened glass) or sapphire crystal,\n\neach with a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic (oil repellent) coating. This coating wears over\n\ntime with normal usage. Cleaning products and abrasive materials will further diminish the\n\ncoating, and may scratch the glass or the sapphire crystal. Using buttons, Digital Crown, connectors, and ports\n \nNever apply excessive pressure\n\nto a button or the Digital Crown on Apple Watch, or force a charging connector into\n\na port, because this may cause damage that is not covered under the warranty. If the\n\nconnector and port don’t join with reasonable ease, they probably don’t match. Check\n\nfor obstructions and make sure that the connector matches the port and that you have\n\npositioned the connector correctly in relation to the port. Certain usage patterns can contribute to the fraying or breaking of cables. The cable\n\nattached to a charging unit, like any other metal wire or cable, is subject to becoming weak\n\nor brittle if repeatedly bent in the same spot. Aim for gentle curves instead of angles in\n\nthe cable. Regularly inspect the cable and connector for any kinks, breaks, bends, or other\n\ndamage. Should you find any such damage, discontinue use of the cable.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"J3AxiqUqmL7di236oYsyJEvSOAzdiV+UfbXVvg2Hscg="},"e803d004-39b3-424b-8bc0-8ffda00dca7c":{"id_":"e803d004-39b3-424b-8bc0-8ffda00dca7c","metadata":{"page_number":386,"total_pages":394},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f12656fc-524f-4d04-846d-3b118ca8e139","metadata":{"page_number":386,"total_pages":394},"hash":"pCrcp63H0r8uDG594xUKaVdJFU8aPtrUu31nHKHxgBk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"10b2bb40-f13a-435f-a63c-6b286cf081ee","metadata":{"page_number":386,"total_pages":394},"hash":"J3AxiqUqmL7di236oYsyJEvSOAzdiV+UfbXVvg2Hscg="}},"text":"Should you find any such damage, discontinue use of the cable.
